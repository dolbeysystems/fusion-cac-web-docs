    <description>The form designer is used to create worksheets for CDI, Coders, Shared Worksheets, Physician Coder, Documentation Review Forms and Query templates.&#xA;A “Shared Worksheet” is a worksheet that can be used by both CDI Specialists and Coders, unlike “CDI Worksheet” and “Coder Worksheet” which are exclusive to CDI and Coding, respectively.&#xA;Forms are used to collect data and/or take notes. For example, CDI Worksheets are used for a CDI to document their thoughts while reviewing a chart.</description>
