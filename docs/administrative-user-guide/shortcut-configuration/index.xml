    <title>Shortcut Configuration :: Fusion CAC Documentation</title>
    <link>https://example.org/administrative-user-guide/shortcut-configuration/index.html</link>
    <description>Shortcut keys help provide an easier and usually quicker method of navigating and executing commands within the software.&#xA;Because some hotkeys may be mapped to a different software solution you are using, we allow you to configure ours. We provide defaults but feel free to change them as needed.&#xA;To record a new, simply press the record button on the line of the function you wish to configure. Enter in a button combination usually between 1-2 keys on the keyboard. For Example, ALT and F9 might submit the chart. We are a browser based application therefore you should not use the standard browser hot keys.</description>
