<p>This program will introduce automatic workflow processes which is defined as processes where tasks,
information or documents are passed from one place to another for action, according to a set of
procedural rules.</p>
<p>Each organization will have different workflows from one another to coordinate tasks between people
and synchronize data between systems, with the ultimate goal of improving organizational efficiency
and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Each CDS will have a worklist which will include new cases if current patient location meets the CDS
work assignments and follow-up cases that the chart owner has been assigned for the CDS reviewing.</p>
<p>For example, if the patient chart is a new case then the patient chart (if it’s an inpatient chart and has a
fin class of Medicare) will route based on the patient’s current location to one of the CDS Workgroups.</p>
<p>By default, the chart will queue up every day (interval can change based on your policies and/or patient
types).</p>

<h1 id="chart-reviews">Chart Reviews</h1>

<p>There are 3 different types of reviews:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial</li>
<li>Follow-up</li>
<li>Reconciliation</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="initial-review">Initial Review</h2>
<p>An initial review is a new case in terms of ‘CDI’ and is referred to as a case that has never been reviewed
by CDI. A CDI review for inpatient charts must have a working DRG associated to be considered
reviewed. If there is no DRG then the patient is considered new.</p>
<p>When a CDI Specialist creates a Baseline DRG (the first Working DRG), then edits the account further
causing the Working DRG to be cleared, and then saves the account without computing a new
Working DRG, the creation of the Baseline DRG also counts as an initial review.</p>
<p>The CDS will review the patient chart documentation and assign any codes necessary to calculate a
working and/or baseline DRG, the CDS may see more codes than are necessary to calculate these. The
codes not needed for calculation of the DRG can be ignored. The codes displayed are all the suggested
dx and procedures to provide a better picture of how coding would look at this chart (the system does
not take the place of a computer; this is the computer’s best guess at how coders would have coded the
chart).</p>
<p>While reviewing, if the CDS have notes they wish to add to the chart they can add an ‘Initial CDI
Worksheet’.</p>
<div class="box notices cstyle note">
  <div class="box-label">
    <i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> CDS Worksheet Fields Are Custom
  </div>
  <div class="box-content">
<p>The CDS worksheet that you see will likely have been customized to your site&rsquo;s needs and preferences.
This section outlines the initial default worksheet prior to customization.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>This worksheet can include any notes that are needed such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical History</li>
<li>Labs/Procedures</li>
<li>Medications</li>
<li>Clinical Indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>If a physician query opportunity is identified, the CDS should query the physician by sending an
electronic query through the navigation menu item listed as Physicians &amp; Queries. When the CDS is in
Physicians &amp; Queries if the provider they wish to query is listed on the page they can click on the red
circle with the envelope icon. If the provider is not listed, they click on Add Query. Either the Add Query
or the Envelope icon will take you to the same place, however if you select Add Query you will need to
manually enter in the provider you wish to query. To create a query, follow these simple steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place your cursor in the field marked Add physician. Start by typing the physician’s last
name. The more you type the more relevant the choices are.</li>
<li>Select a query template from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Select a reason for the query.</li>
<li>Fill out the query template as needed.</li>
<li>Once completed, click send to send the query to the physician.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="follow-up">Follow-up</h2>
<p>A follow-up case in terms of ‘CDI’ is referred to as a case that has already been reviewed at least once by
a CDS. A CDI review for inpatient charts must have a working DRG associated to be considered reviewed.
If no DRG then the patient is considered new. A follow-up case can reoccur; the default interval is every
24hrs until the patient is discharged. However, CDI staff can override this interval by changing the next
review date.</p>
<h2 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h2>
<p>After discharge, the coder will assign a Final DRG. Depending on how your organization has set up the
workflow will depend on what happens after the coder clicks Submit. Some organizations choose to (if
the last known working DRG and the final DRG do not match the charts) flow into a reconciliation queue
for a CDI team member to review. When the coder clicks submit it can either send the chart outbound
and go to the reconciliation queue and if the Coding DRG needs changed it will need to be resubmitted
OR you can choose for the chart to NOT go outbound until CDI reviews the chart and reconciles then
chart then it would go outbound. There are other options however, these are the two most common
workflow paths. If you are performing CDI on outpatient charts this workflow will not apply however,
there are many different ways reconciliation can happen on outpatient charts please call Dolbey to
discuss.</p>
<p>If the DRGs are not a match, the CDI Specialist will see an active Reconcile button instead of the usual
grayed out Submit button.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-a452ce69286b880ee5c14c732dbb6570" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Reconcile Button" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-reviews/image-276.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Clicking on the Reconcile button will bring up a window displaying the DRG difference:</p>

<p>From here the CDI Specialist has 3 options. Clicking Cancel will take them back to the Account screen,
where they can make any coding adjustments or send a Physician Query. Clicking No will result in the
account being closed and the CDI Specialist being back in the Account List. They have not agreed
with the code. Clicking Yes will result in the Working DRG being automatically changed to
match the Final DRG. The account will close and the CDI Specialist will be back on the Account List.</p>
<p>The CDI Dashboard includes data for Today and This Week only, and figures are all based on the current
week. This also provides the CDI Specialist with DRG and reconciliation data.</p>

<h1 id="cdi-alerts-and-chart-prioritization">CDI Alerts and Chart Prioritization</h1>

<p>The software has a feature called CDI Alerts which are automated messages generated by the software
that can be used to prioritize your CDI workflow. CDI Alerts are used to detect potential inaccuracies,
inconsistencies and or discrepancies in clinical documentation. These Alerts help CDI teams to prioritize
the charts based on potential query opportunities available.</p>
<p>The software provides real-time Alerts when potential query opportunities are identified. Which will
then allow CDI staff to prioritize charts based upon those potential opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-cdi-alert-topic">What is a CDI Alert Topic?</h2>
<p>CDI Alert topics are the diagnosis that is being targeted by the Alert. The Topic encompasses a broad
range of diagnoses that address various issues being targeted by our system. These diagnoses then
branch out into more specific types known as Alerts. These are based on the type of issue being
Targeted.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-cdi-alert-message">What is a CDI Alert Message?</h2>
<p>The Alert message is a specific message that details what is missing, incomplete and/or inaccurate
documentation that is missing with the Diagnosis/Topic that is being targeted.</p>
<h2 id="cdi-alert-types">CDI Alert Types</h2>
<p>CDI Alerts branch out into 4 types of Alerts.</p>

For example, if Sepsis was documented by the provider but, it&rsquo;s not supported by Clinical Indicators. This Alert helps to ensure that diagnoses are audit proof. Ensuring that the supporting evidence requiered for a proper diagnsosis validation is present within the patients chart.</td>

      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">**Documentation but Not Fully Specified</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">This is where the provider documented a diagnosis but, it was not documented to its Full Specificity. For example, Heart Failure Unspecified; the diagnosis is not documented to the Full Specificity. This CDI Alert is helpful for ensuring that Diagnoses are documented to their full extent in order to combat denials.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">Conflicting Diagnosis</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">This Alert looks at if there are two or more Fully Specified versions of a diagnosis that maybe potentially conflicting. For example, if the provider or providers in one location documented that a patient had Acute Diastolic Heart Failure and the other location of the patients record it was Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure, this Alert helps to make sure that the proper diagnosis is present to have an accurate patient picture for all care providers involved.</td>
      </tr>

<h2 id="setting-up-cdi-alerts">Setting up CDI Alerts</h2>
<p>In order to set up CDI Alerts you must reach out to the SME Team (<a href="mailto:smeteam@dolbey.com" rel="external" target="_blank">smeteam@dolbey.com</a>) for
assistance there is a module that must be deployed in conjunction with set up within the workflow
management editor.</p>
<h2 id="workgroup-prioritization">Workgroup Prioritization</h2>
<p>Once the CDI Alerts are setup you will see within the workgroup there is a column named “criteria
group” it may be named something different depending on your setup you should check the grid column
configuration if you do not see this field to see if its viewable or has a different name.
These criteria groups are used to indicate a “potential” query opportunities based upon the algorithms.
Once the algorithms meet the criteria to initiate a CDI Alert then it will be matched on in workflow and if
it’s the only Alert it will display as the “ Criteria Group”.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7fc03e9a8c74f7be85a7434e043b412f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Workgroup Prioritization" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-279.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-7fc03e9a8c74f7be85a7434e043b412f"><img alt="Workgroup Prioritization" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow lightbox-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-279.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In cases where multiple Alerts match during workflow execution, the displayed criteria group name will
be determined by the hierarchical list. This hierarchical list is established by your management team
using the workflow management editor. The management team has the ability to rearrange the order of
the Alerts based on priority and initiatives at your hospital, ensuring the Alerts are organized from
highest to lowest priority.</p>
<p>There is also a second grid column called “Active Matched Criteria Groups”. This column will display the
actual number of active CDI Alerts on the account not just the Alert it matched first going through the
workflow list. This column represents the total number of “potential” query opportunities in a patient
record.</p>
<p>You have these two columns available, namely the “Criteria Group” and “Active Matched Criteria
Groups”, which can be utilized to prioritize the worklist. Among these columns, the most valuable one
we feel is the “Active Matched Criteria Groups”. It enables you to concentrate your team&rsquo;s efforts on the
charts that require the most significant improvement, allowing you to prioritize your resources
effectively.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the only Alerts that affect the Priority Criteria Group name and number of
Active Matched Criteria Groups are Active Alerts. Once an Alert is closed it will not be used in these
columns for prioritization. This helps to make sure we are putting the charts with the most priority in
front of the CDIS. As Alerts are closed these numbers will be updated in real time.</p>
<h2 id="viewing-cdi-alerts">Viewing CDI Alerts</h2>
<p>To access and view CDI Alerts within a patient&rsquo;s chart, you can locate them in the
Navigation Pane positioned above the Documents Pane. Below that, you will find
the &ldquo;CDI Alerts” viewer. By clicking on the CDI Alerts viewer, you will notice a box
with an arrow next to CDI Alerts tab in the navigation pane.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-f210c413a269ec989894bc344032fde4" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="CDI in Nav Tree" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-280.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-f210c413a269ec989894bc344032fde4"><img alt="CDI in Nav Tree" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow lightbox-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-280.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Clicking on this box will detach the CDI Alerts Viewer, opening it in a separate
page. This feature allows the end user to move the viewer to a second monitor,
which can be advantageous when toggling through the evidence hyperlinks listed within the CDI Alerts
Viewer. This allows you to easily review the evidence provided without having to continously go back to
the Alerts viewer.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-the-cdi-alerts-viewer">Navigating the CDI Alerts Viewer</h2>
<p>Once in the CDI Alerts Viewer you will notice two headings in the dark blue bars “Active Alerts” and

<h3 id="active-alerts">Active Alerts</h3>
<p>The section “Active Alerts” are Alerts that the system found and no action has been taken meaning
closed by the specialist or queried on.With each Active Alert you’ll notice a word(s) prior to a dash,
which correspond to the CDI Alert Topic..</p>
<p>The words after the dash are a brief description of what the system found to be missing, incomplete or
possibly inaccurate also known as the CDI Alert Message.</p>
<p>After that you will notice and @ sign with a date and time following. This date and time is when the
system found compelling evidence of something missing, incomplete, or possibly inaccurate information
leading to a CDI Alert being iniated. This information is tracked for reporting so you can see how quickly
the system is triggering an Alert.</p>
<h3 id="completed-alerts">Completed Alerts</h3>
<p>The section “Completed Alerts” are alerts that have been closed by either the system Auto-Resolving the
Alert or by the end user taking action either by initating a query or by clicking the close button which is
the red x. You will notice the @ sign with a date and time following. The date and time present is when
the CDI Alert was closed by the system or the end user. You will also see a message after which depicts
how the alert was closed.</p>

<p>Next to each of the Alerts in either the Active or Completed Alerts section is a paper icon.</p>

<p>When you click on that paper icon it will launch you into a notes page. This can be used by a CDIS to
leave a note if they don’t feel the Alert currently doesn’t have enough evidence to build a query but isn’t
necessarily ruled out or seems to be trending towards the diagnsosis Alerted.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8585497a96598d8894deaaef63eb74b5" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="CDI Alert Notes" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-283.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Instead of closing the Alert prematurely if you aren‘t sure if the Alert isn‘t correct it may be useful to
wait and provide a note on why you are waiting becasue new information may present. Once a note is
typed in it will leave the date/time and along with the CDIS name so if another CDIS enters the chart
they will be able to clearly see who chose to monitor the Alert
at this time and why.</p>

<p>Upon adding the note the paper icon will turn red, notifying the next user that is reviewing the CDI Alerts
that there is a note present on the Alert.</p>
<h3 id="cdi-alert-editor-function">CDI Alert Editor Function</h3>
<p>Adjacent to the Alert message, you&rsquo;ll find a pencil icon. Clicking on it will open an editor,
enabling you to rearrange and customize the placement of evidence using a drag-and-drop functionality.
This feature empowers CDIS professionals to organize their items in a personalized manner, aligning
with their specific querying requirements.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-clinical-evidence">Reviewing Clinical Evidence</h3>
<p>Each CDI Alert contains clinical evidence extracted from the patient&rsquo;s chart. There are four different
types of evidence you will see. First are words and phrases within documentation such as signs and
symptoms, and medications. Second are value abstractions from the documentation such as vital signs
or laboratory findings within physical documents. The third are code abstractions from the
documenation. Fourth are discrete values such as laboratory studies and vital signs found in the
flowsheets, medications from the medication viewer and other flowsheet data. Finally, there are links to
documents. These links consist of the document name and connect directly to the respective document.
This feature proves valuable when referencing specific CT Scan documents that may be pertinent to a
particular Alert. This evidence is categorized into sections such as Laboratory Studies, Clinical Evidence,
Vital Signs, and Intake and oOutput Data.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-9fbc22eee13e86e7899f7cfea241ec40" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Reviewing Clinical Evidence" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-286.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-9fbc22eee13e86e7899f7cfea241ec40"><img alt="Reviewing Clinical Evidence" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow lightbox-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-286.png"></a></p>
<p>The blue text serves as a hyperlink. Furthermore, following the abstraction, you will observe word for
phrase in quotes. That is the words or phrases that then engine found in the documentation or values.
Subsequently, either the document name and document date are considered if derived from a
document, or the result date and time are used if obtained from flowsheets. In the case of medication
discrete abstraction, the medication name, dosage, route, and the date and time of administration are
presented.. This helps provide the necessary context. When evidence with a document type and date is
selected it will hyperlink you to the place in the document that abstraction was found and highlight that
yellow. You will also note that there is green highlights with words or phrases in the documentation.
Those are abstractions that are specific to CDI Alerts. They are just like code abstraction, but are what
we use for CDI rules. When you hover your mouse over the green abstraction it will provide you with an
understanding of which Alert the evidence is being used for if there are multiple Alerts present.</p>

<p>When you click on a hyperlinked evidence that is folled by result date and time, indicating a discrete
value abstracted from the flowsheets, it will automatically take you to the corresponding location in the
flowsheets and highlight the respective row.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-04b093134bf773d052da5b38b1596a5f" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Reviewing Clinical Evidence Discrete Value" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-289.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Another noteworthy capability within Clinical Evidence is the ease with which a CDIS can incorporate
additional evidence. While reviewing documentation and flowsheets, if CDIS identifies items deemed
crucial for inclusion in the CDI Alerts as supporting evidence for a query, they can effortlessly highlight
words or phrases in a document, up to a maximum of 1000 characters, and perform a right-click. This
action triggers a menu presenting various options, including one that reads &ldquo;Copy to CDI Alert.&rdquo; Clicking
on this option reveals a pop-out menu displaying available Alerts to which the evidence can be added</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-67447bfb63414f7df31cd5ef0cdae580" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Copy to CDI Alert" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-290.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Upon selecting the desired Alert, the system opens the Evidence Editor, allowing the CDIS to specify
where the evidence should be attached. If the CDIS clicks on existing evidence, the new evidence will be
attached below it. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that, when determining the placement, the CDIS
selects the appropriate location by clicking above. Once the evidence is copied over, the system
provides details such as the evidence itself, the name of the document, and the date. For Laboratory
Studies, it includes the result date and time.</p>
<p>After incorporating the evidence into the designated alert, any highlighted evidence will be displayed in
the document in purple, accompanied by the phrase &ldquo;MANUALLY_ADDED&rdquo; in green at the end. This
informs the user that the evidence was added manually. Similar to other evidence, hovering over the
green-highlighted section will provide information about the CDI Alert to which the item was applied.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-7e7652497eb4fc6cdd5f0146bf58fa7c" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Evidence Editor" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-291.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Next when going back to the CDI Alerts viewer you will notice check boxes present next to the evidence
which serves two purposes. Firstly, if you initiate a query, any evidence marked with a check mark will
be automatically be copied to your clipboard, enabling you to conveniently paste it into your query. This
copying action occurs when you click on the envelope icon</p>
<p>Secondly, unchecking any of the clinical evidence will put a strike through the text and it will prevent it
from being copied over. Additionally, any unchecked evidence will be reported back to Dolbey&rsquo;s clinical
team if an Alert is closed due to it having invalid clinical indicator, insuffiecient clinical evidence or
documentation is already present.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-b7d386cedd41388ffc727575cdc28780" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Unchecking Evidence" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-292.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h3 id="how-to-initiate-a-query">How to initiate a Query</h3>
<p>In the right hand corner of the Alert you will see a blue envelope icon next to a red x icon. When you
click on the blue envelope it will launch you into the query.</p>
<h3 id="query">Query</h3>
<p>Once in the query you will notice that a template will autoload for the specific Alert. These autoloaded
templates can be set by the management staff templates specific to each site and what they use as
querys.</p>
<p>The evidence previously examined on the Alerts viewer page can now be effortlessly incorporated into
the query. When the query button is pressed, the selected evidence will be automatically copied to the
clipboard. You can then paste it using a simple process, either by pressing the &ldquo;ctrl&rdquo; and &ldquo;v&rdquo; keys, the
standard Windows keyboard shortcut for copying, or by performing a right-click and choosing the paste
option. After the query is submitted, the corresponding CDI Alert will transition from the Active Alerts
section to the Closed Alerts section.</p>
<p>Once that query has been submitted that CDI Alert will move from the Active Alerts section down to the
Closed Alerts section.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-3fcc0e6474bc5939727c790f15fa6856" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Unchecking Evidence" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/cds-user-guide/chart-prioritization/image-293.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<h2 id="autoresolve">Autoresolve</h2>
<p>The Alerts have the ability to autoresolve themselves if documentation comes in that would satisfy the
Alert. Once an Alert is Autoresolved it will move to the Close Alert section. This will ensure that we are
only putting Alerts to the end-user that require attention. We don’t want them to have Alerts that need
no action.</p>
<h2 id="closing-alert-without-querying">Closing Alert without Querying</h2>
<p>If a CDIS chooses that an alert needs closed not by a query being initiated by the envelop button. This is
done by clicking the red x and it provides several choices for closing an Alert. There are several options
to state why an Alert is being close without query being sent or placed. There is a section at the bottom
for additional notes that we encourage the specialist to provide a deeper understanding of why the
closed.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-reviews">Documentation Reviews</h2>
<p>If your site does different styles of CDI reviews or want to track management reporting different than
how our default tracks, you can use the documentation review viewer to track reviews by topic. Other
organizations have used this if there CDI team would like to do a utilization management type review
and it doesn’t fit the typical initial or follow up review.</p>
<p>By default, documentation reviews by design have a free form text field however, you can also create
forms within the form designer for each of these reviews.</p>
<p>If your site does not have documentation reviews enabled, and you wish to track reviews different than
the default contact us at <a href="mailto:smeteam@dolbey.com" rel="external" target="_blank">smeteam@dolbey.com</a> we can show you a demo and discuss if this is a good fit

<p>Matched criteria allow you to see why the chart was routed to you. The matched criteria group is a list
of “criteria group” that the chart matched upon when it went through workflow. These criteria groups
are used to indicate a “possible” query opportunity based upon the criteria outlined in workflow.</p>

<h3 id="prioritizing-workflow-using-matched-criteria">Prioritizing Workflow using Matched Criteria</h3>
<p>Matched criteria can be used to prioritize workflow. There are two fields that can be used to prioritize
workflow one is “criteria group” this will tell you the name of the criteria that the workflow routed the
chart to the CDI users often times the field is renamed to “Routed Reason” because this field represents
why the chart was routed to the user. If the chart matches upon many criteria groups the criteria group
that is displayed in this field it the first one that it matched upon all others that it matched upon will
display within the matched criteria viewer when you open the chart.</p>
<p>There is another field named “Active Matched Criteria Groups” this is often renamed to be
“Opportunities” this is defined as the number of matched criteria groups the chart matched on which
reflects the total number of possible query opportunities currently present on the patient chart. This
field can be used by the CDI user to sort the worklist based upon the charts that have the most to least
possible query opportunities.</p>
<p>Once a CDI user validates a criteria group which can be done by checking the box next to the criteria
name. By checking the validation box, this criterion will be removed from consideration for routing
purposes. This will not remove it from routing on other criteria from the workflow if applicable.</p>
<p>If there are two worklist that have the same matched criteria group names the chart had a prior
matched criteria group with the same name already validated, it will not retrigger and display on the
matched criteria viewer.</p>

<h1 id="query-impact">Query Impact</h1>

<h2 id="how-does-the-impact-of-a-query-get-recorded">How does the impact of a query get recorded?</h2>
<p>The impact for inpatient cases is captured by the natural actions a CDS takes, therefore no manual data
entry needs to be tracked by the CDS. The impact of the query is calculated by using the working DRG
calculated within the same session in which you created the physician query for. Then once the
physician replies to the query the CDS will then close the query as agreed, disagreed or no opinion. The
same session that a CDS closes the query the system will then capture the working DRG that was
calculated during this session. A session is closed by saving the chart.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Query Impact = Pre-Query Working DRG Weight – Post-Query Working DRG Weight</code></pre></div>
<p>If physician query shifts the assigned DRG, diagnosis, procedures, CC/MCC/HAC/ROM/SOI or Quality
metrics, the shift reason is automatically calculated by the system. The shift reason is captured by the
system looking at the difference between the last working DRG to the Current Working DRG and Code
Sets the difference in the most current working DRG and code sets will be automatically captured for
reporting.</p>

<h1 id="baseline-drg">Baseline Drg</h1>

<p>The baseline DRG is used for reporting program impact, some organizations do report like this, and
others do not the choice is yours our system accommodates for it if you choose to use it. There are two
styles of impact that can be reported which are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chart Impact</strong></li>
<li><strong>Query Impact</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These are both reporting separately as you could be query positive impact regardless of if the chart has
a positive, negative or neutral impact. The baseline is defined as the DRG that would have been coded
and billed if no CDI specialist reviewed the chart.</p>
<p>You can report the impact of a CDI specialist by measuring the difference between the baseline DRG and
the billed DRG because of your organizations policy that the last know working and final DRG always
match, I we measure impact on last known working and final your impact would always be neutral if we
measure baseline which by default is the first DRG you calculate unless the baseline is readjusted you
may claim to much impact therefore the baseline throughout the patients stay is commonly readjusted.
While the baseline DRG may seem like a simple concept, it can at times be difficult to determine. Here is
an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>A patient is admitted through the ER after presenting with <em>undiagnosed abdominal pain</em>, which
would result in <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>
<span style="color: white; background-color: steelblue; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">392</span>
</span>
with an estimated reimbursed of
<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; background-color: #eeffee">$5,008</span>
</span>.</li>
<li>After further testing, it is revealed the abdominal pain is the result of <em>acute cholecystitis</em>; this
changes the <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>
<span style="color: white; background-color: steelblue; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">446</span>
</span>
(disorders of the biliary tract <strong>without complication</strong>) with an estimated
reimbursement of
<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; background-color: #eeffee">$5,175</span>
.</li>
<li>CDI documents an increased creatinine and a decreased glomerular filtration rate and queries
the physician regarding the patient’s renal status. If the doctor provides proper documentation,
it could be possible to assign a code indicating a <em>complication for Stage IV chronic kidney disease</em>, which would
result in <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>
<span style="color: white; background-color: steelblue; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">445</span>
</span>
(disorders of the biliary tract <strong>with CC</strong>) with an estimated reimbursement of
<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; background-color: #eeffee">$7,464</span>
.</li>
<li>The patient undergoes a <em>laparoscopic cholecystectomy</em>, changing the DRG to <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>
<span style="color: white; background-color: steelblue; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">418</span>
</span>
(laparoscopic
cholecystectomy with CC) with an estimated reimbursed of
<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; background-color: #eeffee">$11,868</span>
.</li>
<li>Next, the patient develops shortness of breath, and the consulting cardiologist documents
<em>acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure</em>, changing the DRG to <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>
<span style="color: white; background-color: steelblue; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">417</span>
</span>
(laparoscopic
cholecystectomy <strong>with MCC</strong>) with an estimated reimbursed of
<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; background-color: #eeffee">$17,478</span>
.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normally, instead of the Baseline being <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>

</span>
which is the first listed, would adjust to
would be readjusted to <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>

</span>
once the patient goes to surgery. If the patient had not gone in for surgery the baseline
would have remained <span style="border-radius: 5px; margin-inline: 0.25em; display: inline-flex">
<span style="color: white; background-color: #333; font-weight: bold; padding-block: 3px; padding-inline: 5px; font-size: 0.75em">DRG</span>

</span>
.</p>
<p>However, none of the CDI impact is lost though because queries are counted separately if you run the query report that CDI would:</p>

</ul>
<p>What I listed above is how some organizations do report not all of them through do this, the choice is up
to your organization. To remind you that your baseline may need updated you can turn on a feature that
upon save it displays a message asking the CDI user if they would like to update there baseline DRG if
the last computed working DRG is different than the baseline. Remember you only want to move the
baseline when the baseline needs reset such as a patient going in for surgery, if you constantly update
the baseline you will show no or little impact. The goal is to show the impact of your work.</p>
