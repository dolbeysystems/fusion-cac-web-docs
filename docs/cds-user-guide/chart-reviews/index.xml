    <description>There are 3 different types of reviews:&#xA;Initial Follow-up Reconciliation Initial Review An initial review is a new case in terms of ‘CDI’ and is referred to as a case that has never been reviewed by CDI. A CDI review for inpatient charts must have a working DRG associated to be considered reviewed. If there is no DRG then the patient is considered new.&#xA;When a CDI Specialist creates a Baseline DRG (the first Working DRG), then edits the account further causing the Working DRG to be cleared, and then saves the account without computing a new Working DRG, the creation of the Baseline DRG also counts as an initial review.</description>
