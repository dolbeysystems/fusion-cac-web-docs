    <description>The software has a feature called CDI Alerts which are automated messages generated by the software that can be used to prioritize your CDI workflow. CDI Alerts are used to detect potential inaccuracies, inconsistencies and or discrepancies in clinical documentation. These Alerts help CDI teams to prioritize the charts based on potential query opportunities available.&#xA;The software provides real-time Alerts when potential query opportunities are identified. Which will then allow CDI staff to prioritize charts based upon those potential opportunities.</description>
