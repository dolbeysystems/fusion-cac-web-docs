    <description>CDI Users Only The Matched Criteria viewer is only shown if your current role is CDI.&#xA;Matched criteria allow you to see why the chart was routed to you. The matched criteria group is a list of “criteria group” that the chart matched upon when it went through workflow. These criteria groups are used to indicate a “possible” query opportunity based upon the criteria outlined in workflow.</description>
