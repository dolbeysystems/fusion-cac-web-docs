<p><strong>Allow customers with encoder other than TruCode to see Partial Code Suggestions</strong></p>
<p>TruCode encoder users today can receive benefits when the documenation is
not fully available for engine to suggest a complete code. In this case,a partial
code is suggested We have added the ability for non-TruCode encoder users
to also enjoy this feature but, TruCode must be liscensed to enable this
feature.
Please contact your sale representative for pricing to enable.</p>
<h3 id="cactwo-3892-enhancement">CACTWO-3892 (Enhancement)</h3>
<p><strong>New section added to Administrative Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>New sections have been added to the Administrative Dashboard: Coding
Trends, Top 10 Queries, and Top 10 Final DRGs. Top 10 Final DRGs has a
dropdown to allow viewing for current month, prior month and last 6 months.</p>
<p>The Top 10 Queries in Last 30 days pane has a dropdown to allow viewing of
all accounts, inpatient accounts or outpatient accounts.</p>
<p>The Coding Trends per Day has a dropdown to allow viewing of Average Daily
Codedand Average TAT to Submit. This pane does not have any grid links
associated with it and is intended for informational purposes only. Coding
Trends are based on the last day work was submitted and does not include
today’s work. The last workday will show in the pane’s title bar.</p>
<h3 id="cactwo-4386-enhancement">CACTWO-4386 (Enhancement)</h3>
<p><strong>New Engine Outcome per CDI report</strong></p>
<p>The Engine Outcome per CDI report shows the total codes that the engine is
suggesting, and what CDI is using vs. what CDI is manually adding compared
to the coder&rsquo;s Final Codes. This report should tell the level of manual effort
per CDI of those codes that are being used for final code assignment by
coders. It will show total assigned codes by CDI broken down by code set along
with how many codes were suggested by the engine versus added by text
documents and non-text documents in addition to those that were added in
duplicate. Duplicate is defined as codes that both the engine and the end-user
added and are notated with an exclamation mark (!) in account detail. There
is also a column to indicate the codes manually added and how many the
coder assigned for final code assignment. This report card should be used as
an educational opportunity to show possible improvements for the end-user
and/or the code suggestions. This report is recommended to be used in
conjunction with an audit. This is not retroactive enhancement.</p>

<p><strong>Add Workgroup Type classifications to each worklist to more accurately depict the  Coding Chart Status Report</strong></p>
<p>In Workflow Management, each workgroup now has a new &ldquo;WorkGroup
Type&rdquo; field. This field is optional, but sites can designate a type for each
workgroup. The purpose of doing so is for current and future reporting. For
this feature, setting a workgroup to a type besides &ldquo;Coding&rdquo; will exclude the
account&rsquo;s time assigned to it in the &ldquo;Coding Chart Status Report&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Workflow groups can now be excluded from the Coding Chart Status Report
if a group other than ‘Coding’ is selected. A new dropdown will appear in the
criteria pane of the workgroup:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e697d65f883b2fa5d7cd71820cc45e4c" class="lightbox-link"><img class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/release-notes/v2.23/image-684.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>The Workgroup Type dropdown is based on a new Mapping Configuration
that the user can add to if desired. A default set is included with the upgrade.
If a user sets this field as anything other than ‘Coding’ or leaves it blank, any
account with this workflow assignment will no longer count in the ‘From
Coding Worklist’ column. In this Inpatient case, the account was assigned to
workflow that had a Workgroup Type of Audit for 1 day, then was moved to
a workflow with a Workgroup Type of Coding for another day before
submission. Only the Coding time is showing in the column.</p>

<p><strong>Add 3 New columns to grid columns</strong></p>

<p><strong>Create Dashboards for Auditors</strong></p>
<p>Two additional Dashboards have been created: Audit Personal Dashboard
and Audit Management Dashboard. With the addition of these dashboards,
the original buttons used for selecting the dashboard have been changed.The
user can either click on the down arrow and drop down to see all the
dashboards, or the user can click the left and right arrows to page through

<p><strong>Work Available list added to all Dashboards</strong></p>
<p>A panel on the dashboards that shows all work available will now show on all
dashboards. The worklist starts with a ‘You’ assignment, then continues down
through all workflow groups in order to how they appear in your users profile.
The columns in this panel are the assigned groups, total charts in each group,
oldest discharge date and total charges.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduled Workflow for Auditors</strong></p>
<p>A new workflow category of Audit has been created which allows its assigned
workgroups to be scheduled to run. When a criteria is created for the
workgroup, a new link for adding an audit will be shown under the criteria
name:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e16d4460298a6348967480294c5db234" class="lightbox-link"><img class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/release-notes/v2.23/image-689.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Clicking on the new link will bring up a schedule box, allowing that criteria to
only be run daily, weekly or monthly.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-ef40de8264185313afc4414c93bc456a" class="lightbox-link"><img class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/release-notes/v2.23/image-690.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Limits for the audit are assigned at the bottom. The first box is a max amount
of accounts to pull into the workgroup, the second box is a percentage of
matched accounts to be pulled in. If both boxes are filled out, the max amount
will override the percentage. This can also be set to be run per group,
selected from the groups drop down field.</p>

<p>The new workflow management page display offers new capabilities
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Vertical Viewing Space for Workgroups - This display
provides an improved vertical viewing space, allowing workgroups to
access and manage their workflows more efficiently.</li>
<li>Side-by-Side Comparison of Workgroups - This will allow users to
compare and analyze workgroups with a side-by-side comparison.</li>
<li>Filtering Ability to Search Workgroups by Specific Fields - This
feature allows you to filter on all workgroups that has a specific field</li>
<li>Cleaner/Sleeker Look and Feel</li>
</ul>
<p>We understand the importance of ensuring a smooth transition. To
accommodate your preferences, we have implemented a convenient option
to switch between the classic view and the new page display. To facilitate the
adoption of this new view, we will be maintaining the classic workflow
management for a few releases. This way, you can transition gradually and
comfortably, choosing the workflow management that suits your immediate
needs. To simplify the transition process further, we have imported all your
existing workflows into the new workflow management system. This means
you can make changes in either of the pages and it updates the other.</p>

maximize the benefits they offer.</p>

<p><strong>Add CDI Alerts Module</strong></p>
<p>The software has a feature called CDI Alerts which are automated messages
generated by the software that can be used to prioritize your CDI workflow.
CDI Alerts are used to detect potential inaccuracies, inconsistencies and or
discrepancies in clinical documentation. These Alerts help CDI teams to
prioritize the charts based on potential query opportunities available.</p>
<p>The software provides real-time Alerts when potential query opportunities
are identified. Which will then allow CDI staff to prioritize charts based upon
those potential opportunities.</p>
<p>CDI Alerts can also be used by coding and auditing charts where CDI did not
review the chart.</p>

<p><strong>Allow lists to be attached to keys in Mapping Configuration</strong></p>
<p>A new Mapping Configuration has been created called
CriteriaFindAndReplace. Once that mapping is created, keys attached to lists
of items can be added. In Account Search,Workflow, and Scheduled Account
Searche, the key can be used after the operator of ‘In List’ or ‘Includes Any Of’
as applicable when creating criteria. The key will allow all items attached to
it to be considered in the equation.</p>
<p>For example, if a user wants to create a key for Elixhauser to be used for the
diagnosis codes within a group, they would add a key of Elixhuaser categories,
with the description being the comma separated list of each of the different
categories for example:</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-0ce1c7a4b9e45d78cb41fd8c202eca26" class="lightbox-link"><img class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/release-notes/v2.54/image-816.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Then, in Account Search, Scheduled Account Search, or Workflow, the user
would use a criteria as shown below. CAC2 will look at ‘ELIX_HF` and apply
the criteria to all of the numbers listed in the Mapping description in the
equation.</p>

<p>If an account had a diagnosis code of I50.20, this criteria would pick it up, since
that code is associated with the key of ELIX_HF.</p>
