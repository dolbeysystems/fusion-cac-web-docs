<p><strong>New Page Display for Workflow Management</strong></p>
<p>The new workflow management page display offers new capabilities
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Vertical Viewing Space for Workgroups - This display
provides an improved vertical viewing space, allowing workgroups to
access and manage their workflows more efficiently.</li>
<li>Side-by-Side Comparison of Workgroups - This will allow users to
compare and analyze workgroups with a side-by-side comparison.</li>
<li>Filtering Ability to Search Workgroups by Specific Fields - This
feature allows you to filter on all workgroups that has a specific field</li>
<li>Cleaner/Sleeker Look and Feel</li>
</ul>
<p>We understand the importance of ensuring a smooth transition. To
accommodate your preferences, we have implemented a convenient option
to switch between the classic view and the new page display. To facilitate the
adoption of this new view, we will be maintaining the classic workflow
management for a few releases. This way, you can transition gradually and
comfortably, choosing the workflow management that suits your immediate
needs. To simplify the transition process further, we have imported all your
existing workflows into the new workflow management system. This means
you can make changes in either of the pages and it updates the other.</p>
<p>This will allow you to become familiar with the enhanced features and
maximize the benefits they offer.</p>
