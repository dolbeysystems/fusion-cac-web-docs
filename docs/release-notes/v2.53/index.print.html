The heading also contains a parenthesized "Change Type", indicating the severity or importance of
the change.  The severities used are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong style="color: darkred">Critical</strong> - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at all sites
  running previous versions.
  <li><strong style="color: orange">Conditionally Critical</strong> - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at
  all sites running previous versions matching the stated conditions.
  <li><strong style="color: green">Important</strong> - Recommended upgrading the application if the customer is experiencing the issue
  denoted or currently applying a work-around for a specific non-functional feature.
  <li><strong style="color: blue">Enhancement</strong> - Recommended upgrading only if the specific functionality is desired.
</ul>

<h3 id="new-module-enhancement">New Module (Enhancement)</h3>
<p><strong>Add CDI Alerts Module</strong></p>
<p>The software has a feature called CDI Alerts which are automated messages
generated by the software that can be used to prioritize your CDI workflow.
CDI Alerts are used to detect potential inaccuracies, inconsistencies and or
discrepancies in clinical documentation. These Alerts help CDI teams to
prioritize the charts based on potential query opportunities available.</p>
<p>The software provides real-time Alerts when potential query opportunities
are identified. Which will then allow CDI staff to prioritize charts based upon
those potential opportunities.</p>
<p>CDI Alerts can also be used by coding and auditing charts where CDI did not
review the chart.</p>

<p><strong>Allow multiple Denials to be added to a single account</strong></p>
<p>The Denial Management viewer will now allow multiple sheets to be created.
Sheets can also be deleted via a red X to the right of each Denial heading.

<p>Currently, if a user was in an account that had an open physician query, and
an external interface closed that query, the count on the Account List for the
Query Total would still show the query open. This has been changed so that
the query total on the account is updated upon closing the account.</p>
<h2 id="cactwo-5481-enhancement">CACTWO-5481 (Enhancement)</h2>
<p><strong>Users with multiple roles would like column orders to be maintained</strong></p>
<p>Currently, if a user has multiple roles (e.g., Coder, Auditor, CDI Specialist),
when the columns are changed for one role, the other roles are automatically
set to match. This has been changed so that column changes for Account List,
Charges and Transaction Viewers, and Medication viewers can now all be
unique to each role.</p>

<p><strong>Allow Validation Rule to add a Pending Reason</strong></p>
<p>In Validation Management, a new field has been added to the rules that are
created called Pending Reason. This field will have a dropdown with all
available pending reasons. If a rule is triggered on an account and it has a
pending reason attached, then the pending reason will be added and the user
will be able to see the number of the rule. Pending reasons that have a
physician or date requirement will NOT be available in this list. The only way
to remove a pending reason that was added by a rule is to have that rule
cleared.</p>

<p><strong>Add zoom in and out ability to text based documents</strong></p>
<p>The ability to zoom in and out has been added as a right click option in
documents, both on the main page and a pop out. This new zoom feature will
work for Chrome and Edge users. When a user selects a zoom level, that level
will be retained for all documents and the last zoom used before log out is the
