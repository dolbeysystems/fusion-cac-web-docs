<p><strong>Hide supporting evidence from documents</strong></p>
<p>Supporting evidence will now be hidden from documents by default. If the
supporting evidence dialog is open, clicking on the icon next to the code will
reveal the secondary codes. This will now be hidden to reduce the white noise
of codes on a chart; however, the evidence is still available. Upon opening the
supporting evidence dialog you will see the evidence markers.</p>

<p><strong>Allow TruCode™ edits while computing with any other encoder</strong></p>
<p>If a site uses an encoder other than TruCode and wants to use the TruCode
edits to supplement their existing encoder they can now do so to display MCE,
OCE, and medical necessity edits (NCD/LCD).</p>

<p><strong>Allow physicians to be attached to pending reasons from Account Search</strong></p>
<p>If a pending reason is added to an account from account search and is
configured to have a physician attached, the user can now add that physician
in Account Search. Either single or multiple accounts can be highlighted, then
in the right click menu, after Add Pending Reason is selected, if the pending
reason selected from the dropdown is set to trigger for physician, the
physician entry box will be displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Testing Steps</strong>: In Mappings Configuration, make sure you have at least one
pending reason that requires a physician. In Account Search, select one or
more accounts, then right-click and choose &ldquo;Add Pending Reason&rdquo;. Note that
if you select a pending reason that requires a physician, an additional
physician drop down appears. If the pending reason requires a physician, the
physician cannot be left blank. After selecting a physician reason and
physician, load the account and examine the Code Summary viewer. The
physician should be present with the newly added pending reason.</p>

<p><strong>Allow mass removal of pending reasons in Account Search</strong></p>
<p>If an account has multiple pending reasons, they will now all be removable
using Account Search. In Account Search, the user will need to create a search
using the Pending Reasons Drill Down Level. Highlighting one of the lines on
the account (pending reasons each have their own lines) and right clicking to
select Delete Pending Reasons will delete all reasons on the account without
having to highlight each line.</p>

<p><strong>Add number ordering for criteria groups</strong></p>
<p>Using Grid Column Configuration, first add the columns Custom Criteria
Sequence and Criteria Sequence. With these added to the Account List, users
will be able to see the sequence of the criteria group. The sequence will also
be viewable in Workflow Management, in front of each criterion. Re-
arranging the criteria list will update the sequence number as needed.</p>

&ldquo;Account List&rdquo; checkboxes are checked. (Note that these columns are not
added automatically; not all sites will use this feature.)</p>
<p>The criteria group sequence number is now displayed in Workflow
Management. When an account is assigned to a workgroup and criteria group,
the criteria group sequence is now recorded with the workgroup assignment.
The column &ldquo;Criteria Sequence&rdquo; will display the sequence number for default
workflow and the column &ldquo;Custom Criteria Sequence&rdquo; will display the
sequence number for custom workflow. Like with &ldquo;Criteria Group&rdquo;, these
columns are swapped when examining a specific workgroup in the Account
List page, depending on whether the workgroup is a default workgroup or a
custom workgroup. The &ldquo;Matched Criteria Groups&rdquo; viewer will also display the
sequence number for matched criteria.</p>

<p>A new column, Hide Coding, has been added to Document Types
Management, allowing the user to choose to show suggested codes based on

menu on the Document tree now has an Expand option that allows for
collapse or expand of documents. There is no longer a code expansion, that
is done by the plus sign only. On the Unassigned/All Codes tree, in the right

most dashboards, except for the Autoclose, Discharged Not Final Coded, and
any panel displaying user counts. The top of the dashboard contains the filter,
and once the user clicks to filter and selects the facilities desired, clicking the
refresh button will refresh all the panels to only show the results for that
facility or facilities.</p>
