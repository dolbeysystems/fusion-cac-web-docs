<p><strong>Incorrect document is staying in focus</strong></p>
<p>If a code from the Show All Codes tree is assigned to more than one
document, and the user clicks on one of those documents, it opens in the
document viewer. But if the user then clicks on a different document and
adds a code to it, the former document shows in the viewer instead of the
currrently opened one. This has been corrected.</p>

<p><strong>Valid Value error occurring in some Account Search filters</strong></p>
<p>An error message asking for a valid value was occuring during some Account
Search filters that used the ‘=’ sign. This was occuring when fields had a
mapping that did not include a blank key. This has been corrected. An
example was if you had Stage = Unbilled then switched the equal to not equal
it would give you the error. Previously you would have to click on unbilled
switch off of it then back on it in the drop down for it to take effect. This has
been corrected.</p>
