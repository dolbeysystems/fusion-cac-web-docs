<p><strong>Tooltip is incorrect in Account Search</strong></p>
<p>When an Account Search filter is saved, the tooltip is not showing that user’s
ID until the Account Search Page is left and re-accessed. Also, the date/time
of the tool tip was showing the date/time the Account Search was loaded, not
the date/time of the last change to that filter. This has been corrected.</p>

<p><strong>Allow EM E/R cofigurations to be copied to mutliple facilities</strong></p>
<p>If a user has a Facility Mapping, the EM E/R Configurations can now be copied
between the various facilities. If the user works has a Facility mapping, a new
option will appear in the top right of the screen allowing selection of one of
the facilities. Once a facility is chosen, that facilities levels will appear. A new
Copy button will show at the top of the Levels section. Clicking it will open a
dialog asking the user what facility to copy those current levels to. The levels
will be presented in a dropdown. In this case, I am in Dolbey South –
Cincinnati, and when I select the copy button, I have the option to pick
another facility to copy those levels to:</p>
