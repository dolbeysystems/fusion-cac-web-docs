corrected.</p>
<h2 id="cactwo-5519-important">CACTWO-5519 (Important)</h2>
<p><strong>Inpatient Coder Scorecard report not filtering user properly</strong></p>
<p>When filtering by user, the report was not evaluating that user as the Audit
coder of record; instead it was evaluating as the auditor that opened the
audit. This has been corrected for both the Audit – Inpatient Coder Scorecard
and the Audit- Outpatient Coder Scorecard.</p>
<h2 id="cactwo-5532-important">CACTWO-5532 (Important)</h2>
<p><strong>Working History is duplicating</strong></p>

<h2 id="cactwo-5534-important">CACTWO-5534 (Important)</h2>
<p><strong>Engine Outcome per CDI report needs a column change</strong></p>

<p>In the Unassigned Codes pane, any code attached to that document will show
in a yellow background, and will not have the option to assign on the right
click menu.</p>
