    "content": "Account Search is helpful for reporting when creating a report that is not in the default user reports. Account Search allows you to search most data points to export the raw data into a CSV file. To begin creating an account search, think about what you want to gain for the data. A few examples:\nHow many inpatient charts were discharged last month with a principal diagnosis of sepsis? What charts that were discharged have pending reasons? Of the inpatient types discharged last month and coded, what is the total of each CC and MCCs? To do any of the above you will need to filter the data because the account search can pull all chart data available in the system. Start by clicking on ‘Add Criteria’ and select the fields to constrain the data. Looking for submitted data? Use Stage = Submitted Looking for data discharged from last month? Click on edit next to admit datetime and change to discharge date is last month. Continue to constrain the data based upon what you are looking for. There are about 100+ fields that you can use to constrain the data. Each site will have their own custom fields, depending on how the system was configured.\nAccount Search Drilldown Level Account search allows for the ability to search for account level data or drill down to an array of different data collections.\nAccount (Default) Denials Final Assigned Codes Final CPT Codes Final Diagnoses Final Procedures Final Visit Reasons Pending Reasons Physician Coding Assigned Codes Physicians Queries Working Assigned Codes Working CPT Codes Working Diagnoses Working Procedures Working Visit Reasons When a choice other than Account, which is the default view, is selected the columns for that choice are added to the beginning of the original grid.\nThe above shows some of the rows associated with the Drill-Down Level of Final Diagnosis. The drill- down level can be saved to the grid. For example, if there is a grid the user has called Unsubmitted, and the user added the Final Procedure drill-down to it, then when Unsubmitted is pulled up in Account Search, it will include the drill-down columns and the name of the drill-down will appear in the drill- down level field instead of the default of Account\nOnce you have the data constrained, select the columns you want to display by selecting the Tools Button. If you click on the drop down arrow on the “Tools” Button you can select or unselect all columns. Use the check box to indicate you want to display the column and uncheck to remove the column from the account search or scheduled account search report.\nSearching for Data The data filter allows you to constrain the data before returning results in account search grid. For example, if you are looking for patient charts that CDI reviewed for the month of April you can run a filter that looks like this. If you want to learn more about the fields and how they are defined you can navigate to the fields collection chapter in this user guide.\nAdding Criteria Account searches can be created using AND or OR criteria. Account Search is super dynamic in the types of data points you can pull. Account Search, much like workflow, has two different options to create a filters using the AND/OR criteria.\nAND criteria OR Criteria. Example of AND Criteria At the end of each criterion, you add an “AND” (see below). This criterion will cause the account search to display results if the patient chart had both the coder AND the CDI user identifying a PSI.\nExample of OR Criteria At the end of each criterion, you add an “OR” (see below). The OR criteria will display in blue to differentiate between the first and second criteria that will trigger the results. This criterion will cause the account search to display results if the patient chart had either the coder OR the CDI user identifying a PSI.\nColumn Filter Each column, when you hover over the column, has menu options to filter the data to restrict the view for only the data the user has defined.\nHow to manually filter:\nClick the bar icon on the column you wish to filter. Click on the Filter icon. Check or uncheck the boxes depending on the data you wish to filter, then click on the filter to close the box. The new filter will be applied. Once you return the data you can then choose the columns you wish to display data. Initially when you return results there will be more column fields displayed than what you really need. You can pair down the columns by removing or adding the columns that are needed.\nGroup Rows You can additionally choose to group the data creating a pivot table by grouping rows to provide a different view for the data.\nUsing the data to create a pivot table allows you to reorganize the selected columns and rows of data in account search grid table to obtain a desired report. The fields that can be filtered on and/or displayed can be found in the available fields section of this document.\nExport to CSV Export in the CSV format which allows you to view in Excel. Exporting will maintain the columns and grouping.\nAccount Search Report Scheduler A button will appear for users in Account Search to open a dialog box to create/edit/delete a schedule, which will be limited to one schedule per filter. To schedule an account search report, first create a filter and save. Then you will see the new button called “+ Add Report Scheduler”.\nFill in each of the boxes shows below.\nOnce you fill this out and save you will notice the button changes so you can edit the scheduled report from account search.\nYou can also see the account searches that were scheduled under the reporting tabs and scheduled user reports.",

    "content": "There are 3 different types of reviews:\nInitial Follow-up Reconciliation Initial Review An initial review is a new case in terms of ‘CDI’ and is referred to as a case that has never been reviewed by CDI. A CDI review for inpatient charts must have a working DRG associated to be considered reviewed. If there is no DRG then the patient is considered new.\nWhen a CDI Specialist creates a Baseline DRG (the first Working DRG), then edits the account further causing the Working DRG to be cleared, and then saves the account without computing a new Working DRG, the creation of the Baseline DRG also counts as an initial review.\nThe CDS will review the patient chart documentation and assign any codes necessary to calculate a working and/or baseline DRG, the CDS may see more codes than are necessary to calculate these. The codes not needed for calculation of the DRG can be ignored. The codes displayed are all the suggested dx and procedures to provide a better picture of how coding would look at this chart (the system does not take the place of a computer; this is the computer’s best guess at how coders would have coded the chart).\nWhile reviewing, if the CDS have notes they wish to add to the chart they can add an ‘Initial CDI Worksheet’.\nCDS Worksheet Fields Are Custom The CDS worksheet that you see will likely have been customized to your site’s needs and preferences. This section outlines the initial default worksheet prior to customization.\nThis worksheet can include any notes that are needed such as:\nMedical History Labs/Procedures Medications Clinical Indicators If a physician query opportunity is identified, the CDS should query the physician by sending an electronic query through the navigation menu item listed as Physicians \u0026 Queries. When the CDS is in Physicians \u0026 Queries if the provider they wish to query is listed on the page they can click on the red circle with the envelope icon. If the provider is not listed, they click on Add Query. Either the Add Query or the Envelope icon will take you to the same place, however if you select Add Query you will need to manually enter in the provider you wish to query. To create a query, follow these simple steps.\nPlace your cursor in the field marked Add physician. Start by typing the physician’s last name. The more you type the more relevant the choices are. Select a query template from the drop-down menu. Select a reason for the query. Fill out the query template as needed. Once completed, click send to send the query to the physician. Follow-up A follow-up case in terms of ‘CDI’ is referred to as a case that has already been reviewed at least once by a CDS. A CDI review for inpatient charts must have a working DRG associated to be considered reviewed. If no DRG then the patient is considered new. A follow-up case can reoccur; the default interval is every 24hrs until the patient is discharged. However, CDI staff can override this interval by changing the next review date.\nReconciliation After discharge, the coder will assign a Final DRG. Depending on how your organization has set up the workflow will depend on what happens after the coder clicks Submit. Some organizations choose to (if the last known working DRG and the final DRG do not match the charts) flow into a reconciliation queue for a CDI team member to review. When the coder clicks submit it can either send the chart outbound and go to the reconciliation queue and if the Coding DRG needs changed it will need to be resubmitted OR you can choose for the chart to NOT go outbound until CDI reviews the chart and reconciles then chart then it would go outbound. There are other options however, these are the two most common workflow paths. If you are performing CDI on outpatient charts this workflow will not apply however, there are many different ways reconciliation can happen on outpatient charts please call Dolbey to discuss.\nIf the DRGs are not a match, the CDI Specialist will see an active Reconcile button instead of the usual grayed out Submit button.\nClicking on the Reconcile button will bring up a window displaying the DRG difference:\nFrom here the CDI Specialist has 3 options. Clicking Cancel will take them back to the Account screen, where they can make any coding adjustments or send a Physician Query. Clicking No will result in the account being closed and the CDI Specialist being back in the Account List. They have not agreed with the code. Clicking Yes will result in the Working DRG being automatically changed to match the Final DRG. The account will close and the CDI Specialist will be back on the Account List.\nThe CDI Dashboard includes data for Today and This Week only, and figures are all based on the current week. This also provides the CDI Specialist with DRG and reconciliation data.",

Admit Date w/ Time Computed to display the patient’s admit date with the admit time Admit Diagnosis Codes This is the admit diagnosis code of the patient chart. Admit Reason This is the admit reason which comes from ADT. Admit Source This is the admit source of the patient chart. Admit Type This is the admit type on the patient chart. Admitting Physician Computed to display the first physician name with a role of Admitting. Admitting Physician ID Computed to display the first physician ID with a role of Admitting. Age in Years Computed to display the patient’s age in years. Assigned CPT Code This is used to search for a chart with an assigned CPT code. Assigned Diagnosis Code This is used to search for a chart with an assigned diagnosis code. Assigned POA Assigned Procedure Codes This is used to search for a chart with an assigned procedure (PCS) code. Assigned Visit Reason Codes This is used to search for a chart with an assigned visit reason code. Attending Physician Computed to display the first physician name with a role of Attending Attending Physician ID Computed to display the first physician ID with a role of Attending AutoClose Date/Time This is the date and time the patient chart was autoclosed.

Baseline Working DRG Weight This is the Baseline DRG Weight. Baseline Working Estimated Reimbursement This is the Baseline DRG Estimated Reimbursement. Billing Countdown The billing countdown will tell you how many days left to bill the payor. In Mapping Configuration, if you add or edit a mapping for “Payor”, you see a new “Default Bill Days” field in the header and a new “Bill Days” column for each Payor. These fields contain numbers zero or higher or blank to indicate the number of days to add to the discharge date (current date is there is no discharge date) to calculate what is basically a billing due date. The billing date is compared to the current date (or the last submitted date if the account is already submitted) to compute the “Billing Countdown” – the number of days left to submit an account. If an account has no payor, no matching payor mapping, or payor mapping with no “bill days” defined, the “default bill days” is used (zero if “default bill days” is blank as well.) Bed This is the last known patients bed. Birth Weight (g) This is the patients birth weight in grams. This can be provided either through the ADT interface or manually entered by a coder. Building This is the last known patients building which is usually equal to the nursing unit or location. Campus This is the last known patient’s campus. Category This is a Dolbey created patient type to assist with reporting because often a patient type field needed to be joined with a location, hospital service or other fields to alter reporting for productivity categories join those fields to create custom patient types for easy productivity and DNFC reporting.

Please review these release notes carefully when deciding to apply a software update to an installation. Each note is related to an issue tracking assignment number (starting with CACTWO) in the heading. Please refer to the change with this tracking assignment number when communicating questions or issues. The heading also contains a parenthesized \"Change Type\", indicating the severity or importance of the change. The severities used are: Critical - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at all sites running previous versions. Conditionally Critical - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at all sites running previous versions matching the stated conditions. Important - Recommended upgrading the application if the customer is experiencing the issue denoted or currently applying a work-around for a specific non-functional feature. Enhancement - Recommended upgrading only if the specific functionality is desired. CACTWO-3581 (Enhancement) Allow customers with encoder other than TruCode to see Partial Code Suggestions\nTruCode encoder users today can receive benefits when the documenation is not fully available for engine to suggest a complete code. In this case,a partial code is suggested We have added the ability for non-TruCode encoder users to also enjoy this feature but, TruCode must be liscensed to enable this feature. Please contact your sale representative for pricing to enable.\nCACTWO-3892 (Enhancement) New section added to Administrative Dashboard\nNew sections have been added to the Administrative Dashboard: Coding Trends, Top 10 Queries, and Top 10 Final DRGs. Top 10 Final DRGs has a dropdown to allow viewing for current month, prior month and last 6 months.\nThe Top 10 Queries in Last 30 days pane has a dropdown to allow viewing of all accounts, inpatient accounts or outpatient accounts.\nThe Coding Trends per Day has a dropdown to allow viewing of Average Daily Codedand Average TAT to Submit. This pane does not have any grid links associated with it and is intended for informational purposes only. Coding Trends are based on the last day work was submitted and does not include today’s work. The last workday will show in the pane’s title bar.\nCACTWO-4386 (Enhancement) New Engine Outcome per CDI report\nThe Engine Outcome per CDI report shows the total codes that the engine is suggesting, and what CDI is using vs. what CDI is manually adding compared to the coder’s Final Codes. This report should tell the level of manual effort per CDI of those codes that are being used for final code assignment by coders. It will show total assigned codes by CDI broken down by code set along with how many codes were suggested by the engine versus added by text documents and non-text documents in addition to those that were added in duplicate. Duplicate is defined as codes that both the engine and the end-user added and are notated with an exclamation mark (!) in account detail. There is also a column to indicate the codes manually added and how many the coder assigned for final code assignment. This report card should be used as an educational opportunity to show possible improvements for the end-user and/or the code suggestions. This report is recommended to be used in conjunction with an audit. This is not retroactive enhancement.\nCDI Feature You must be using Fusion CAC for CDI to view this report.\nCACTWO-4412 (Enhancement) Add Workgroup Type classifications to each worklist to more accurately depict the Coding Chart Status Report\nIn Workflow Management, each workgroup now has a new “WorkGroup Type” field. This field is optional, but sites can designate a type for each workgroup. The purpose of doing so is for current and future reporting. For this feature, setting a workgroup to a type besides “Coding” will exclude the account’s time assigned to it in the “Coding Chart Status Report”.\nWorkflow groups can now be excluded from the Coding Chart Status Report if a group other than ‘Coding’ is selected. A new dropdown will appear in the criteria pane of the workgroup:\nThe Workgroup Type dropdown is based on a new Mapping Configuration that the user can add to if desired. A default set is included with the upgrade. If a user sets this field as anything other than ‘Coding’ or leaves it blank, any account with this workflow assignment will no longer count in the ‘From Coding Worklist’ column. In this Inpatient case, the account was assigned to workflow that had a Workgroup Type of Audit for 1 day, then was moved to a workflow with a Workgroup Type of Coding for another day before submission. Only the Coding time is showing in the column.\nCACTWO-4601 (Enhancement) Add 3 New columns to grid columns\nThree new fields are available in grid columns for use in account search: Time Spent by CDI, Time Spent by Coding and Time Spent by First Coder. This change is not retroactive.\nCACTWO-4654 (Enhancement) Create Dashboards for Auditors\nTwo additional Dashboards have been created: Audit Personal Dashboard and Audit Management Dashboard. With the addition of these dashboards, the original buttons used for selecting the dashboard have been changed.The user can either click on the down arrow and drop down to see all the dashboards, or the user can click the left and right arrows to page through each dashboard choice.\nCACTWO-4691 (Enhancement) Work Available list added to all Dashboards\nA panel on the dashboards that shows all work available will now show on all dashboards. The worklist starts with a ‘You’ assignment, then continues down through all workflow groups in order to how they appear in your users profile. The columns in this panel are the assigned groups, total charts in each group, oldest discharge date and total charges.\nWork Available Numbers Are Not Clickable Most dashboard numbers in blue are clickable, but on the work available queues they are not since some users are in force autoload mode and therefore this view is simply a view of whats available in each.\nCACTWO-4692 (Enhancement) Allow Forced Autoload user to view the new Work Available Queue\nA new privilege called ‘View Work Available Queue in Forced Autoload has been added to Role Management. When this option is enabled, a Forced Autoload user will now see the Work Available Queue on the dashboard.\nNote This feature requires Roles Management to be enabled.\nCACTWO-4698 (Enhancement) Scheduled Workflow for Auditors\nA new workflow category of Audit has been created which allows its assigned workgroups to be scheduled to run. When a criteria is created for the workgroup, a new link for adding an audit will be shown under the criteria name:\nClicking on the new link will bring up a schedule box, allowing that criteria to only be run daily, weekly or monthly.\nLimits for the audit are assigned at the bottom. The first box is a max amount of accounts to pull into the workgroup, the second box is a percentage of matched accounts to be pulled in. If both boxes are filled out, the max amount will override the percentage. This can also be set to be run per group, selected from the groups drop down field.\nCACTWO-4700 (Enhancement) Add assigned workgroup to top of Audit Worksheet\nThe top of the Audit worksheet will now display any Workgroup assignments for that account.\nCACTWO-4704 (Enhancement) Add buttons to move through document tree\nNew backward and forward arrows have been added to the top of the Documents panel. This will allow the user to move up and down through the documents listed in the panel.\nCACTWO-4705 (Enhancement) Add buttons to move through viewer panel\nNew backward and forward arrows now appear to the left in the blue bar of the document viewer. This will allow users to move back and forth through documents that have been opened into the viewer screen. Note that when a user arrows back and forth, then clicks on another document, the user is starting a new history for that option.\nCACTWO-4707 (Enhancement) Add ability to drill down to physician queries in Account Search\n‘Queries’ has been added to the Drill-Down Level options in Account Search. This will automatically add Queries columns to the resulting account search without the user having to add them. These default columns appear at the beginning of the grid and can be moved to other positions.\nCACTWO-4710 (Enhancement) Add ‘Query For’ field on queries to further define generic queries.\nThe new field will appear under the template name,. This additional “Query For” field will allow the template reason to be more specified.\nThe text that is added in this field will show in a new ‘Query For’ column in these reports: Outstanding Queries, Query Impact by Discharge Date, Query Impact Report, Query TAT by Author Report and Query Template Volume Overview. In order to see this new field you must add it to the template created in forms designers.\nCACTWO-4716 (Enhancement) Add internal note for physician queries\nInternal only notes can now be added to Physician Query templates from the form designer.\nOn a template, clicking the Insert dropdown will now show a new option of Add Internal Note. The Internal note is only displayed for the user filling out the query and is not set to the provider receiving the query. Selecting this option will add a highlighted free text line to the document\nWhen adding a physician query the user will see the highlighted section in the query when that template is selected.\nAfter sending, this note will no longer be seen unless the user has the privilege of ‘Edit Open Queries to resend’ in Role Management. An Edit checkbox will show on the dte line, and checking it will show the query with the internal note.\nCACTWO-4721 (Enhancement) Allow Validation Rules to be exported\nA new ‘Export’ button has been added to the top of the page under the save rules button of the Validation Management page. Clicking on the down arrow will give the user the ability to export as a CSV file.\nCACTWO-4722 (Enhancement) Add chatroom to Validation Management\nThe chatroom that automatically opens if more than one user is in the same page has been added to Validation Management.\nCACTWO-4724 (Enhancement) Add Pending Reason drop down to Account List\nThe Account List dropdown button now has the option for a list of pending accounts. When Pending Accounts is chosen, the user will get a list of any accounts they have added a pending reason to.\nCACTWO-4731 (Enhancement) Add ‘You’ count to the Dashboard\nThe dashboards have a Work Available Queue panel. ‘You’ has been added to the list of workflow to show accounts that are assigned to that user.\nCACTWO-4733 (Enhancement) When ESC is selected while in a field it will clear new contents\nBy putting your cursor in any of the above text fields. If the field has an original value, then change it, then press ESC. The field should revert to its original value before you placed the cursor in the field (note: not the original field from the database).\nAccount Search System Search Tuning Dashboard Validation Management Workflow Management CACTWO-4741 (Enhancement) Move Cancel button in Physician Query\nThe Cancel button has been moved a little farther away from the send button on a Physician Query to alleviate accidental clicks.\nCACTWO-4748 Enhancement Add columns to Account Search Pending Reasons drilldown\nWhen drilling down on Pending Reasons in Account Search, new and updated automatic columns will be added: Added By, Added On, Current Role, Physician, Service Date.\nCACTWO-4754 (Enhancement) Change portions of the Audit Management viewer\nIn Audit Management viewer the Abstractions section of the viewer are no longer included in the Overall section. The Overall section has been renamed Overall Code Statistics. The tooltips in this section will no longer include the Abstracting values.\nCACTWO-4755 (Enhancement) Add Stages to the CDI Query Detail Report\nA new column for “Stage” has been added to the right of the “Financial Class” column in the CDI Query Detail Report.\nCACTWO-4758 (Important) Reports updated to improve performance\nSeveral user reports were timing out when the user was on a large database. Updates to reporting have been made to fix those performance problems. The reports affected are:\nCase Mix Index Report by Attending Physician Outstanding Queries Pending Reasons Query Overview Query Stats Query Template Volume Overview CACTWO-4762 (Enhancement) Allow for editing of text when changing physician on a query\nWhen a user chooses to change a physician on a physician query after it is sent, the other fields on the query will also be open to editing the original query will retrain oringal text and can be found in the query list as “Cancelled”\nCACTWO-4765 (Enhancement) Save section selection/arrangement when editing queries\nAll dynamic sections on physician querieswill be saved and viewable when editing a set query. Prior to this, when sections were changed on a query and the query sent, if subsequently edited, the changed sections would revert to their original positions. This will no longer happen. Testing Steps: Create any query with a template using sections. Rearrange/hide sections, populate some values, and send the query. Open the query and click the “Edit” checkbox to edit the query (if you are a non-Administrator, you need a privilege enabled to see the “Edit” checkbox). When you edit the query, the rearranged/hidden sections are still rearranged and hidden. Previously, all sections reverted to their original display.\nCACTWO-4766 (Enhancement) Populate the name field with the grid column name\nWhen adding a new column in Grid Column Configuration, the Title will now automatically be defaulted to the field name. You can still change the friendly name if the automatic name is not what you want to use.\nCACTWO-4769 (Enhancement) Replace ‘filters’ with ‘criteria’\nThe word ‘filter’ has been changed to ‘criteria/criterion’ throughout the Workflow Management page for clarification purposes.\nCACTWO-4774 (Enhancement) Allow Autoload users work lists to be updated live\nIf a change is made to an Force Autoload user’s worklist in his profile, the user will no longer have to log out and log back in to get the new sequence. It will happen automatically.\nCACTWO-4777 (Enhancement) Add more drilldown ability to Administrative Dashboard\nOn the Admin Dashboard, Total Charts AutoClosed Today and Total ChartsRejected Today statistics will now be drilldowns.\nCACTWO-4780 (Enhancement) Add Auditor count to Administrative Dashboard\nThe Admin Dashboard will now show Auditors Online and Offline in the Users Online pane.\nCACTWO-4781 (Enhancement) Change Coder Productivity Pending data in the Admin Dashboard\nOn the Admin Dashboard Coder Productivity Pending Info and $ will only reflect discharged patients. The coder Productivity Pending Info and $ should only reflect discharged patients. We are using the pending info/$ to show DNFB which is Discharged Not Final Billed and we are capturing non- discharged patients here as well.\nCACTWO-4782 (Enhancement) Add Case Mix Index pane to Administrative Dashboard\nOn the Admin Dashboard a section for Case Mix Index has been added . This pane will show the Last 7 Days, 30 Days, 90 Days and 180 Days.\nCase Mix Index is defined as the sum of DRG Relative Weights divided by the number of accounts with a DRG Relative Weight.\nCACTWO-4783 (Enhancement) Add Working Case Mix Index pane to CDI Management Dashboard\nOn the CDI Management Dashboard a section for Case Mix Index for Working DRGs has been added as a pane to the Administrative Dashboard. This pane will show the Last 7 Days, 30 Days, 90 Days and 180 Days.\nThe Working Case Mix Index numbers come from the sum of Working DRG Relative Weights divided by the number of accounts with a Working DRG Relative Weight.\nCACTWO-4785 (Important) Errors occurring in the Discharged Not Final Coded report\nWhen a large data amount is being reported, the Discharged Not Final Coded report would not complete as an XLSX and gave incorrect data. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4786 (Important) Missing physician validation rule is not being triggered\nA rule to trigger for a missing physician that was set up in Validation Manager was not triggering when the account did not have a physician. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4788 (Important) Large accounts cause Validation Rule delays\nLong stay accounts with thousands of documents were not triggering Validation Rules in an acceptable amount of time. Performance has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4789 (Enhancement) Allow Physician ID to be added to CDI Query Detail report as XLSX\nThe CDI Query Detail report will now add a Physician ID column only when it is exported as a XLSX.\nCACTWO-4795 (Important) Missing drilldown columns from Account Search\nWhen a drilldown is used in an Account Search filter, the columns associated with that drilldown are added to the results grid. But when scheduled as a report, those columns were not showing in the report. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4797 (Enhancement) Reassign a chart after a specified time period\nA new field has been added to workflow to allow accounts to be assigned to new workgroups if they have sat too long in their original workgroup.\n“WorkGroup Assigned Date” has been added to Workflow Management. When used, this field adds a new optional workgroup field to type in the name of a workgroup. By doing so, the workflow engine will check the assigned date/time of the specified workgroup to determine assignment eligibility.\nTo test, assign any account to any workgroup (manually or automatically, doesn’t matter). In Workflow Management, create or edit a custom workgroup with the criteria “WorkGroup Assigned Date” –\u003e name of the workgroup you assigned the account to –\u003e “More Than” –\u003e 1 day ago. Let the Script Engine run overnight. At midnight workflow additionally assign the account to your custom workgroup. If it didn’t, attach the Script Engine log for review.\nWhen implemented at the site, to mimic “24 hours”, the criteria should be “More Than –\u003e 2 days ago” since workflow works off days and not times.\nCACTWO-4798 (Enhancement) Change how Audit accuracy fields appear in Account Search\nIn Account Search, any Audit accuracy fields were showing as a decimal point. This has been changed to show as a percentage.\nCACTWO-4803 (Important) Weekly Coder Activity report receiving disconnect error\nA connection error was occurring when running the Weekly Coder Activity Report multiple times. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4804 (Important) Not correctly checking codes for validity using the 3M CRS Encoder\nWhen using 3M CRS encoder, the Discharge Date was used for figuring validity of a code in 3M CRS. Any outpatient accounts that have a discharge date that is after the admit date are then likely to get coded with invalid codes. Correction has been made so that outpatient accounts use the admit date as the discharge date for figuring whether a code is valid.\n3M CRS Users Only This fix only applies to 3M CRS users.\nCACTWO-4805 (Important) Document Type Management was not saving mass edit changes\nDocument type changes were not being saved properly when using mass edit or changing document group assignments. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4806 (Important) Restored images are being marked as new documents\nIf an image that has been purged is restored by redownloading, it was being marked as a new document. This has been corrected so that restored images are given an original import date to keep it from being considered as a new document.\nCACTWO-4813 (Important) Validation rules not being triggered properly for empty fields\nA validation rule that looks for a field match was not being considered when the field was blank. These operators have been updated to ensure that if a property is an empty string, the validation rule will interpret it the same way as if the field was null or didn’t exist: Not Equal, Not In List, Not Contains and Does not Exist.\nCACTWO-4817 (Important) Data in Audit comment bubbles is not being retained\nText that is attached to a code in an Audit via the comment bubble was not being retained when sent to the Coder from the Auditor. This has been corrected. The code will remain with the red bubble, which when hovered over or clicked on will show the text.\nCACTWO-4823 (Important) Physician deactivation is calculated in inconsistent ways\nIf a physician’s deactivation date is during an inpatient account timeline, they could still be assigned to a procedure if the date is after the physician’s deactivation date. For the sake of consistency, the procedure date will be looked instead of the account date to determine if a physician is deactivated.\nCACTWO-4825 (Important) Display of sample date on monthly run reports is not correct\nWhen a report is scheduled to run in a monthly format, the ‘sample’ date that is shown to the right does not match the month dates. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4826 (Important) Role Management not giving ‘save’ reminder\nWhen in Role Management and making a change, the user is not being reminded to save when attempting to leave and open a different page. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4830 (Important) Change how duplicate codes are calculated in Audit Worksheet\nWhen a procedure code is duplicated by a coder and an Auditor then updates the Audit worksheet, one of the codes was being calculated as an additional code. This has been corrected so that intentional duplicates are not read as extra codes.\nCACTWO-4831 (Enhancement) Change coloring of Code Summary to red for warnings\nThe Code Summary shows as red in the Navigation Pane if there is a validation error. Validation warnings in the Code Summary will display in red, to indicate more attention needs to be paid to the validation rule.\nCACTWO-4836 (Important) Single Path Coder is not able to submit an account\nAn error was occurring when a Single Path coder role attempted to submit an account. This has been corrected. Single Path coders can both save and submit.\nCACTWO-4838 (Enhancement) Allow Account Search on accounts without date properties\nThe user can now run an Account Search based on an account number without using a date property criterion. If a user puts together Account Search criterion without having a date or account number field, they will receive a new pop-up warning box:\nCACTWO-4851 (Important) Scheduled Report is being duplicated\nIf a user accidently double clicked while saving an Account Search as a Scheduled Report, two reports were being recorded. This has been corrected. Multiple clicking will only result in one ‘save’ of a scheduled Account Search report.\nCACTWO-4863 (Important) Data entered on a pop-out worksheet not appearing on main viewer\nWhen popping out a worksheet and then moving to a different document on the main viewer, if the user added data to the popped-out worksheet and then on the main tab moved from the document back to that worksheet, the data would not show in the main viewer.

    "content": "The software has a feature called CDI Alerts which are automated messages generated by the software that can be used to prioritize your CDI workflow. CDI Alerts are used to detect potential inaccuracies, inconsistencies and or discrepancies in clinical documentation. These Alerts help CDI teams to prioritize the charts based on potential query opportunities available.\nThe software provides real-time Alerts when potential query opportunities are identified. Which will then allow CDI staff to prioritize charts based upon those potential opportunities.\nWhat is a CDI Alert Topic? CDI Alert topics are the diagnosis that is being targeted by the Alert. The Topic encompasses a broad range of diagnoses that address various issues being targeted by our system. These diagnoses then branch out into more specific types known as Alerts. These are based on the type of issue being Targeted.\nWhat is a CDI Alert Message? The Alert message is a specific message that details what is missing, incomplete and/or inaccurate documentation that is missing with the Diagnosis/Topic that is being targeted.\nCDI Alert Types CDI Alerts branch out into 4 types of Alerts.\nAlert Type Description No Documentation but, Clinical Indicators This Alert type is when the provider did not document a Diagnosis but, there are Clinical Indicators that support “Possible Diagnosis”. Documentation but lack of Clinical Indicators This is where the provider documented the diagnosis but there is a lack of Clinical Indicators that support the diagnosis. For example, if Sepsis was documented by the provider but, it’s not supported by Clinical Indicators. This Alert helps to ensure that diagnoses are audit proof. Ensuring that the supporting evidence requiered for a proper diagnsosis validation is present within the patients chart. **Documentation but Not Fully Specified This is where the provider documented a diagnosis but, it was not documented to its Full Specificity. For example, Heart Failure Unspecified; the diagnosis is not documented to the Full Specificity. This CDI Alert is helpful for ensuring that Diagnoses are documented to their full extent in order to combat denials. Conflicting Diagnosis This Alert looks at if there are two or more Fully Specified versions of a diagnosis that maybe potentially conflicting. For example, if the provider or providers in one location documented that a patient had Acute Diastolic Heart Failure and the other location of the patients record it was Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure, this Alert helps to make sure that the proper diagnosis is present to have an accurate patient picture for all care providers involved. Setting up CDI Alerts In order to set up CDI Alerts you must reach out to the SME Team (smeteam@dolbey.com) for assistance there is a module that must be deployed in conjunction with set up within the workflow management editor.\nWorkgroup Prioritization Once the CDI Alerts are setup you will see within the workgroup there is a column named “criteria group” it may be named something different depending on your setup you should check the grid column configuration if you do not see this field to see if its viewable or has a different name. These criteria groups are used to indicate a “potential” query opportunities based upon the algorithms. Once the algorithms meet the criteria to initiate a CDI Alert then it will be matched on in workflow and if it’s the only Alert it will display as the “ Criteria Group”.\nIn cases where multiple Alerts match during workflow execution, the displayed criteria group name will be determined by the hierarchical list. This hierarchical list is established by your management team using the workflow management editor. The management team has the ability to rearrange the order of the Alerts based on priority and initiatives at your hospital, ensuring the Alerts are organized from highest to lowest priority.\nThere is also a second grid column called “Active Matched Criteria Groups”. This column will display the actual number of active CDI Alerts on the account not just the Alert it matched first going through the workflow list. This column represents the total number of “potential” query opportunities in a patient record.\nYou have these two columns available, namely the “Criteria Group” and “Active Matched Criteria Groups”, which can be utilized to prioritize the worklist. Among these columns, the most valuable one we feel is the “Active Matched Criteria Groups”. It enables you to concentrate your team’s efforts on the charts that require the most significant improvement, allowing you to prioritize your resources effectively.\nIt’s important to note that the only Alerts that affect the Priority Criteria Group name and number of Active Matched Criteria Groups are Active Alerts. Once an Alert is closed it will not be used in these columns for prioritization. This helps to make sure we are putting the charts with the most priority in front of the CDIS. As Alerts are closed these numbers will be updated in real time.\nViewing CDI Alerts To access and view CDI Alerts within a patient’s chart, you can locate them in the Navigation Pane positioned above the Documents Pane. Below that, you will find the “CDI Alerts” viewer. By clicking on the CDI Alerts viewer, you will notice a box with an arrow next to CDI Alerts tab in the navigation pane.\nClicking on this box will detach the CDI Alerts Viewer, opening it in a separate page. This feature allows the end user to move the viewer to a second monitor, which can be advantageous when toggling through the evidence hyperlinks listed within the CDI Alerts Viewer. This allows you to easily review the evidence provided without having to continously go back to the Alerts viewer.\nNavigating the CDI Alerts Viewer Once in the CDI Alerts Viewer you will notice two headings in the dark blue bars “Active Alerts” and “Completed Alerts”. When you click on the either of these headings you can either expand or collapse that section and hide or view any alerts present under those sections\nActive Alerts The section “Active Alerts” are Alerts that the system found and no action has been taken meaning closed by the specialist or queried on.With each Active Alert you’ll notice a word(s) prior to a dash, which correspond to the CDI Alert Topic..\nThe words after the dash are a brief description of what the system found to be missing, incomplete or possibly inaccurate also known as the CDI Alert Message.\nAfter that you will notice and @ sign with a date and time following. This date and time is when the system found compelling evidence of something missing, incomplete, or possibly inaccurate information leading to a CDI Alert being iniated. This information is tracked for reporting so you can see how quickly the system is triggering an Alert.\nCompleted Alerts The section “Completed Alerts” are alerts that have been closed by either the system Auto-Resolving the Alert or by the end user taking action either by initating a query or by clicking the close button which is the red x. You will notice the @ sign with a date and time following. The date and time present is when the CDI Alert was closed by the system or the end user. You will also see a message after which depicts how the alert was closed.\nResolved Type Definition CDI Audit Education Opportunity This is an opportunity for education. Insufficient Clinical Evidence The abstracted evidence was insufficient to support the alert. Documentation already present Documentation for the condition related to the alert is present on the account. Handled with query A physician query was opened for this alert. CDI Alert Notes Next to each of the Alerts in either the Active or Completed Alerts section is a paper icon.\nWhen you click on that paper icon it will launch you into a notes page. This can be used by a CDIS to leave a note if they don’t feel the Alert currently doesn’t have enough evidence to build a query but isn’t necessarily ruled out or seems to be trending towards the diagnsosis Alerted.\nInstead of closing the Alert prematurely if you aren‘t sure if the Alert isn‘t correct it may be useful to wait and provide a note on why you are waiting becasue new information may present. Once a note is typed in it will leave the date/time and along with the CDIS name so if another CDIS enters the chart they will be able to clearly see who chose to monitor the Alert at this time and why.\nUpon adding the note the paper icon will turn red, notifying the next user that is reviewing the CDI Alerts that there is a note present on the Alert.\nCDI Alert Editor Function Adjacent to the Alert message, you’ll find a pencil icon. Clicking on it will open an editor, enabling you to rearrange and customize the placement of evidence using a drag-and-drop functionality. This feature empowers CDIS professionals to organize their items in a personalized manner, aligning with their specific querying requirements.\nReviewing Clinical Evidence Each CDI Alert contains clinical evidence extracted from the patient’s chart. There are four different types of evidence you will see. First are words and phrases within documentation such as signs and symptoms, and medications. Second are value abstractions from the documentation such as vital signs or laboratory findings within physical documents. The third are code abstractions from the documenation. Fourth are discrete values such as laboratory studies and vital signs found in the flowsheets, medications from the medication viewer and other flowsheet data. Finally, there are links to documents. These links consist of the document name and connect directly to the respective document. This feature proves valuable when referencing specific CT Scan documents that may be pertinent to a particular Alert. This evidence is categorized into sections such as Laboratory Studies, Clinical Evidence, Vital Signs, and Intake and oOutput Data.\nThe blue text serves as a hyperlink. Furthermore, following the abstraction, you will observe word for phrase in quotes. That is the words or phrases that then engine found in the documentation or values. Subsequently, either the document name and document date are considered if derived from a document, or the result date and time are used if obtained from flowsheets. In the case of medication discrete abstraction, the medication name, dosage, route, and the date and time of administration are presented.. This helps provide the necessary context. When evidence with a document type and date is selected it will hyperlink you to the place in the document that abstraction was found and highlight that yellow. You will also note that there is green highlights with words or phrases in the documentation. Those are abstractions that are specific to CDI Alerts. They are just like code abstraction, but are what we use for CDI rules. When you hover your mouse over the green abstraction it will provide you with an understanding of which Alert the evidence is being used for if there are multiple Alerts present.\nWhen you click on a hyperlinked evidence that is folled by result date and time, indicating a discrete value abstracted from the flowsheets, it will automatically take you to the corresponding location in the flowsheets and highlight the respective row.\nAnother noteworthy capability within Clinical Evidence is the ease with which a CDIS can incorporate additional evidence. While reviewing documentation and flowsheets, if CDIS identifies items deemed crucial for inclusion in the CDI Alerts as supporting evidence for a query, they can effortlessly highlight words or phrases in a document, up to a maximum of 1000 characters, and perform a right-click. This action triggers a menu presenting various options, including one that reads “Copy to CDI Alert.” Clicking on this option reveals a pop-out menu displaying available Alerts to which the evidence can be added\nUpon selecting the desired Alert, the system opens the Evidence Editor, allowing the CDIS to specify where the evidence should be attached. If the CDIS clicks on existing evidence, the new evidence will be attached below it. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that, when determining the placement, the CDIS selects the appropriate location by clicking above. Once the evidence is copied over, the system provides details such as the evidence itself, the name of the document, and the date. For Laboratory Studies, it includes the result date and time.\nAfter incorporating the evidence into the designated alert, any highlighted evidence will be displayed in the document in purple, accompanied by the phrase “MANUALLY_ADDED” in green at the end. This informs the user that the evidence was added manually. Similar to other evidence, hovering over the green-highlighted section will provide information about the CDI Alert to which the item was applied.\nNext when going back to the CDI Alerts viewer you will notice check boxes present next to the evidence which serves two purposes. Firstly, if you initiate a query, any evidence marked with a check mark will be automatically be copied to your clipboard, enabling you to conveniently paste it into your query. This copying action occurs when you click on the envelope icon\nSecondly, unchecking any of the clinical evidence will put a strike through the text and it will prevent it from being copied over. Additionally, any unchecked evidence will be reported back to Dolbey’s clinical team if an Alert is closed due to it having invalid clinical indicator, insuffiecient clinical evidence or documentation is already present.\nHow to initiate a Query In the right hand corner of the Alert you will see a blue envelope icon next to a red x icon. When you click on the blue envelope it will launch you into the query.\nQuery Once in the query you will notice that a template will autoload for the specific Alert. These autoloaded templates can be set by the management staff templates specific to each site and what they use as querys.\nThe evidence previously examined on the Alerts viewer page can now be effortlessly incorporated into the query. When the query button is pressed, the selected evidence will be automatically copied to the clipboard. You can then paste it using a simple process, either by pressing the “ctrl” and “v” keys, the standard Windows keyboard shortcut for copying, or by performing a right-click and choosing the paste option. After the query is submitted, the corresponding CDI Alert will transition from the Active Alerts section to the Closed Alerts section.\nOnce that query has been submitted that CDI Alert will move from the Active Alerts section down to the Closed Alerts section.\nAutoresolve The Alerts have the ability to autoresolve themselves if documentation comes in that would satisfy the Alert. Once an Alert is Autoresolved it will move to the Close Alert section. This will ensure that we are only putting Alerts to the end-user that require attention. We don’t want them to have Alerts that need no action.\nClosing Alert without Querying If a CDIS chooses that an alert needs closed not by a query being initiated by the envelop button. This is done by clicking the red x and it provides several choices for closing an Alert. There are several options to state why an Alert is being close without query being sent or placed. There is a section at the bottom for additional notes that we encourage the specialist to provide a deeper understanding of why the closed.\nDocumentation Reviews If your site does different styles of CDI reviews or want to track management reporting different than how our default tracks, you can use the documentation review viewer to track reviews by topic. Other organizations have used this if there CDI team would like to do a utilization management type review and it doesn’t fit the typical initial or follow up review.\nBy default, documentation reviews by design have a free form text field however, you can also create forms within the form designer for each of these reviews.\nIf your site does not have documentation reviews enabled, and you wish to track reviews different than the default contact us at smeteam@dolbey.com we can show you a demo and discuss if this is a good fit for your organization.\nBy clicking on “+ Add Review” you can select the type of review that you wish to complete.\nReview Type List Configuration The list of review types presented here are configurable by a site administrator through Mapping Configuration.\nThen, type in your notes. Finally, click Ok to save.\nEach review is saved, there are custom management reports to report out specific reviews and the CDI Management and CDI Personal Dashboard will all change to accommodate these custom reviews, if you do not have this enabled custom review info will be hidden since its not appliable.",

It is the provider’s responsibility to determine if a more specific code from that subcategory is available in the medical record documentation by a clinical provider.\nIf additional information to identify the laterality from the available medical record documentation by any other clinical provider is unable to be obtained or there is documentation in the record that the physician is clinically unable to determine the laterality because of the nature of the disease/condition, then the provider must enter that information into the remarks section.\nSpecifically, the provider may enter “UNABLE TO DET LAT 1” to identify that they are unable to obtain additional information to specify laterality or they may enter “UNABLE TO DET LAT 2” to identify that the physician is clinically unable to determine laterality. If not entered, the claim will be returned.\nDolbey can support the addition of this field to your account information viewer and send the necessary information, known as the billing note, downstream if required. If this is something that you need, please reach out to the Dolbey SME Team at smeteam@dolbey.com. Below is an example of what it could look like in the account information viewer.",

    "content": "V2.24.8129 Released 04/04/22 The notes below indicate changes and additions to the software. Please review these release notes carefully when deciding to apply a software update to an installation. Each note is related to an issue tracking assignment number (starting with CACTWO) in the heading. Please refer to the change with this tracking assignment number when communicating questions or issues. The heading also contains a parenthesized \"Change Type\", indicating the severity or importance of the change. The severities used are: Critical - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at all sites running previous versions. Conditionally Critical - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at all sites running previous versions matching the stated conditions. Important - Recommended upgrading the application if the customer is experiencing the issue denoted or currently applying a work-around for a specific non-functional feature. Enhancement - Recommended upgrading only if the specific functionality is desired. CACTWO-4838 (Enhancement) Do not require date fields for Account Number searches\nIn Account Search, filters cannot be completed unless there is a date field included in the criteria. This has been changed so that if the user is searching on a particular account number, they will not be alerted to select a date field.\nCACTWO-4857 (Enhancement) Add columns to System Search\nNew columns have been added to the System Search page: Admit Date, Discharge Date, First Submitter and Facility. They will appear as the last columns and have the same sorting and filtering abilities as other columns on the page.\nCACTWO-4867 (Enhancement) Alert user for PrincipalDX usage on inpatient accounts\nThe PrincipalDX button on the Compute Dropdown is for use on TruCode™ encoder inpatient accounts only. If a user accidently deploys it on an outpatient account, the result is a blank screen. If a user does this, they will receive a message stating the PrincipalDX option is only for inpatient accounts.\nTruCode™ Users Only This fix only applies to TruCode™ users.\nCACTWO-4871 (Enhancement) Add Workgroup column to User Audit Trail report\nThe User Audit Trail report has a new column that will display the name of the workgroup the user opened the noted account from.\nCACTWO-4872 (Enhancement) Allow TruCode™ to be opened from Anesthesia codes\nThe TruCode™ Encoder codebook can now be opened by clicking on an Anesthesia Code in the TruCode™ Research Panel. For TruCode™ Encoder users only.\nCACTWO-4900 (Enhancement) Allow ‘Does Not Include’ to include a multi-string value\nCurrently in Validation Management Rules, using the operator ‘Does Not Include’, such as Diagnosis Codes – Does not Include – only allows for one property, such as R05.\nThis has been changed to allow for multiple properties. For Diagnosis Codes – Does not Include – R05, R06.02, I10, the rule will trigger if the account does not include all of those codes. If the account has one of those codes, the rule will not trigger.\nCACTWO-4905 (Enhancement) Add Physician Coding Summary to the Navigation Pane\nWhen a physician coder adds codes to an account, a coder working in that account will now see an Physician Coding Summary viewer listed in the Navigation Pane.\nCACTWO-4913 (Important) Editing a suggested PCS code is not defaulting the date and physician\nThe date and physicians that are populated on a document from an interface, then default onto PCS codes. When PCS codes are assigned, the defaulted data is held. But, if a user edits a code while it is still unassigned, the date and physician are not being defaulted in the Edit Code box. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4914 (Important) The HCC viewer was not displaying correctly on multiple MRN accounts\nWhen multiple accounts have the same MRN and the earliest account has an HCC status on a code, the later account is not creating a Previous HCC Overview viewer in the Navigation Pane. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4915 (Important) Short Cut keys are not performing according to the menu\nThe Keyboard Shortcuts menu under the Help button was displaying incorrect data for some of the code assignment shortcuts. These have been corrected.\nCACTWO-4916 (Important) Workflow Categories not being deleted properly\nIf one of the five default workflow categories (Audit, Autoclose, Post Discharge, CDI/Concurrent, QA Review) is deleted when no workgroups are present, returning to Workflow reinstates that Category. This has been corrected so that empty categories remain deleted.\nCACTWO-4920 (Important) Receiving error when submitting accounts with codes on image\nIn some instances, when codes are added to an image file and the account is submitted while the user still had the image in their viewer, an error message was occuring. The underlying issue has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4921 (Enhancement) Allow all codes in TruCode™ Edit panel to be clickable\nAny code that appears in the TruCode™ Edit Encoder panel can now be clicked to open the Codebook to that code. Please note that if the user has a pop-up blocker deployed, this can interfere, so it should be turned off . For TruCode™ Encoder users only.\nCACTWO-4922 (Enhancement) Remove ‘+’ sign when not necessary in the Transactions Viewer\nIn the Charge Transactions Viewer, the ‘+’ sign indicates multiple instances, and can be clicked to show them. This change will take the ‘+’ sign away from any transaction that has a single instance to prevent unnecessary clicking.\nCACTWO-4924 (Enhancement) Add new Caution Column to Transactions and Charges viewers\nA new Caution Column has been added to the Transactions and Charges viewers for TruCode™ users. This column will indicate a flag if TruCode reports an edit on a charge on an outpatient account.\nTruCode™ Users Only This fix only applies to TruCode™ users.\nCACTWO-4927 (Enhancement) Add Physician Coder criteria to Validation Management\nNew user level criteria has been added to Validation Management: Is Physician Coder, Is Not Physician Coder\nCACTWO-4928 (Important) PSI indicators not displaying if procedure code is a multiple\nIf a procedure code appeared twice on an account, but had different procedure dates, the PSI code was not being triggered. This has been corrected.\nQuality Module Users Only This fix only applies to Quality Module users.\nCACTWO-4929 (Enhancement) The Engine Outcome per Coder report has been updated\nNew updates have been made to the Engine Outcome per Coder report.\nFor each ‘Total For’ value, the result has been changed from an average to a sum. All subtotal values are now whole numbers. User Score and Engine Accuracy percentage show as whole numbers. CACTWO-4931 (Important) Create a warning if account is locked in use\nA new warning will appear at the top of any document that has been updated while the account has been locked in use.\nCACTWO-4935 (Enhancement) New drilldown for Physician Coding added to Account Search\nA new drilldown menu that will present data for Physician Coding Assigned Codes has been added to Account Search.\nCACTWO-4936 (Enhancement) Add new column to Physician Code Summary viewer\nA Physician Coder will now see an additional column in the account’s Code Summary viewer, identifiying any Diagnosis Codes that were attached to the Procedure Codes.\nCACTWO-4939 (Important) Account comments with emojis are not saving properly\nIf a user added a comment with an emoji to a note on an account, the account saved, but when later accessed, would not resave the account. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4943 (Enhancement) Add new operator to the Physician Roles field in Validation Management\nA new operator of ‘More then Ten of’ has been add to the Physician Roles field in the Validation Management page. Using this will alert the user that there are more than 10 of a certain physician role on an account.\nSingle Path Coding Only This feature requires the physician coder or single path coding module. Please contact SME Team at smeteam@dolbey.com if you want to learn more.\nCACTWO-4944 (Important) Blank procedure date not triggering validation rule\nWhen a CPT code without a date was added to an account, the validation rule which looked for non-existing procedure dates was not triggered. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4947 (Enhancement) Allow HTML within text fields to not cause display issues\nPreviously, HTML was allowed in text fields, but some characters such as \u003c / \u003e = were causing a display issue. The update has been corrected to allow those characters to display correctly.\nCACTWO-4949 (Enhancement) New Query Template Volume by Discharge Date has been created\nThis report is close to the Query Template Volume Overview report except that it reports by discharge date, not query creation date. Only queries of discharged accounts will show on this report.\nCACTWO-4950 (Enhancement) Allow Workgroups and Criteria to use an ‘or’ statement\nWorkgroups and workgroup criteria within Workflow Mangement can now include an ‘or’ statement. When clicking on the criteria link, and the dropdown opens the user will now see an option to add an ‘or’ group:\nClicking on the “Add OR Group” results in a line that states ONE of the following with an “Add OR Criteria” link.\nExample of OR Criteria This is an example of an “OR” criteria. Essentially, at the end of each criteria you will add an ADD or an OR so it looks like the below. Based on this criteria, the chart will fall into the Inpatient Surgery worklist if the chart has a patient type of Inpatient AND the patient has been discharged and the patient has EITHER a hospital service of SUR OR the Documents must include an Operative Report or OP Note. The OR criteria is listed in blue to call attention.\nCACTWO-4953 (Enhancement) Allow ability for Workflow to have quoted, comma separated values\nWhen creating criteria in Workflow Management, the user can now use double quotes around a value that contains a comma to show it is all one value:\nCACTWO-4959 (Important) TruCode™ DRG Analysis tab is not populating\nWhen a Primary Grouper is identified as a TruCode™ grouper and the Secondary Grouper is identified as a GPCS Grouper, the TruCode™ DRG Analysis tab is not displaying correct data if it is available. This has been corrected. For TruCode™ Encoder users only.\nCACTWO-4960 (Enhancement) Allow Validation Manager to support double quotes\nIn the instance of document names with commas, Validation Management reads the entry as two separate documents. Users can now use double quotes around a document with a comma in its name to prevent that split. As an example, if the user wanted to make a list search for a document called Admit, Covid19, they would write the rule as “Admit, Covid19” so that it is read as one document, not two.\nCACTWO-4961 (Enhancement) Allow for double quoted documents in Account and System Search\nDouble quotes can now be used around document types that have commas inside them when searching using Account Search and System Search. In this case, the document type of Admit, Covid-19 would be written as “Admit, Covid- 19” so that the system reads it as one document, not two\nCACTWO-4964 (Enhancement) Add a column for Forced Autoload to User Management\nA new column for Forced Autoload has been added to the User Management grid. To turn it on, access the ag-grid and check the box. The new column appears first in the grid after the Actions column, and can be moved anywhere on the grid.\nCACTWO-4965 (Enhancement) Autoset Exempt POA in realtime\nThe Exempt POA status will now be set in realtime for any POA-exempt diagnosis codes that are assigned. The issue occured when an account was originally outpatient when FAE results were received (no POA) and then the account was changed to inpatient or the code was originally not POA-exempt prior to a coding update and then the patient remained in-house after the coding update.\nCACTWO-4968 (Enhancement) Combine default and custom workgroups into new columns\nNew columns added to Grid Column Configuration “All Criteria Groups” and “All Workgroups”. These columns will show default and custom workgroups and criteria together, comma separated.\nCACTWO-4972 (Important) The hospital services field is not being saved correctly in reports\nWhen creating a user report, if the Hospital Services field was filled and then saved, it looked like it saved. But exiting and re-entering that report showed the field as being blank. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4977 (Important) Slowness in Account Search for very large results\nA process improvement has been made to speed up the results for Account Search where the criteria search includes long periods of time for large amounts of data.\nCACTWO-4978 (Important) Scheduled report being triggered to save without changes made\nWhen opening an older scheduled report, the user was receiving a ‘save’ prompt when closing. This was due to another field being added by the system behind the scenes. The save prompt will no longer show unless the user makes a change or selection.\nCACTWO-4983 (Enhancement) Add new column to CDI Activity report\nA new column called Time Spent has been added to the end of the CDI Activity report. This will show the time the CDI spent within the stated Category.\nCACTWO-4984 (Enhancement) Change Document Type Management to stop group removal\nWhen right clicking on any field in the Document Type Management page, the user will no longer have the Tools option to remove grouping rows. Grouping rows must stay static.\nCACTWO-4987 (Important) Change conflict occuring on null fields\nThe change conflict feature is not treating null fields the same as empty fields, causing the box to pop when it shouldn’t. This has been changed so that null, undefined, and empty fields are all treated the same.\nCACTWO-4988 (Important) Transferred codes are not in the correct order\nWhen using the Transfer Account Codes viewer, the codes that are selected are being copied over in reverse order. This has been changed so that the codes copied are in the same order as on the originating account.\nCACTWO-4989 (Important) HTML code is appearing the in TruCode™ encoder\nWhen a user highlights words in a document and right clicks and selects Add Code from Encoder, sometimes HTML coding is appearing in the TruCode™ encoder. The system has been updated to interpret that code as a blank space.\nTruCode™ Users Only This fix only applies to TruCode™ users.\nCACTWO-4990 (Important) Physician ID drop down is not readable at screen bottom\nThe Physician ID field drops down in the Physicians \u0026 Queries pane, but when the user is at the bottom of the screen, the results cannot be seen. This field has been changed so that it will drop up the list, instead of dropping the list down when at the bottom of the screen.\nCACTWO-4992 (Important) Account change window popping during document saves\nWhen an account is opened that has an automatically added form, if the user saves without adding anything to the form, then adds to the form and saves again, the account change window was displaying. This has been corrected so that the window no longer displays.\nCACTWO-4995 (Enhancement) Create field for Alternate DRG\nA new field has been created called Alternate Reconciled DRGs. This field can be added to grids using the Grid Column Management page. Once added, it will display manually recorded DRGs that have been added by a CDI Specialist in the Working CDI History viewer.\nCACTWO-5000 (Important) Forced Autoload user is not being advanced to their next account\nIf a Force Autoload user was working in an account while an administrator was changing the assigned workgroup limits on that user, the user was not advanced to the next assigned account upon submission of the current one. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5005 (Important) Change CSV export view for transaction\nWhen right clicking in the transactions viewer to export to CSV, the grouping row was showing up as a line in the report. If there were two transactions under Group 88888, it was showing in the CSV report as three rows, when it was only two. This has been corrected to no longer show the grouping row.\nCACTWO-5054 (Important) Prevent blank query when changing physician of responded query\nIf you click “Change Physician” on a physician query with a response, the new physician query will no longer be blank.\nER E/M Module The ER E/M Viewer is an add-on module that was partially released within 2.23 for beta testing therefore the release notes below are changes made to this release. If you do not have this module, you can contact the SME Team (smeteam@dolbey.com) for more information\nCACTWO-4877 (Enhancement) Collapse options in the ER E/M Configuration page\nThe options in the ER E/M Configuration page (Trauma, No Charge, etc) can now be collapsed and expanded to allow proper focus when working in this page. Clicking ‘Add’ on any option will auto-expand the option panel.\nCACTWO-4925 (Important) Multiple issues with the new ER E/M Viewer\nThese items in ER E/M Viewer were corrected or changed:\nSend Charges Outbound is now a checkbox New Assigned CPT Codes section will appear above Summary A History section will list prior submitted E/M charges below Summary If a duration of critical care is entered, the following two questions (Criteria Met and Time Determined) must have an answer of Yes to suppress the E/M Level entry Modifier(s) can be added if a critical care charge is present The quantity for a charge indicating ‘initial’ can only be 0 or 1 Erroneous Conflict Check will no longer occur. CACTWO-4937 (Enhancement) ER E/M Coding added to Validation Management\nThe E/M Coding viewer can now be set as a navigation option in Validation Management. If the rule that is set with this navigation is triggered, the account will bring up that viewer. In this instance, if a procedure code exists but does not have a procedure date on it, the validation rule will trigger and will take the user to the account’s E/M Coding viewer.\nCACTWO-4938 (Important) E/M Coding viewer not showing as read-only\nWhen an account is in read-only mode, the E/M Coding viewer was not. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-4945 (Enhancement) Identify E/M Coding that has not been sent outbound\nThe E/M Coding Viewer has a button to send the coding outbound. The viewer name will now be colored red if the coding exists but has not been sent, to alert users. Once the coding is sent outbound, the color of the viewer name will change back to black.\nCACTWO-4948 (Enhancement) Add display for current E/M Coding charges in Code Summary\nThe bottom of the Code Summary viewer will now display the totals of the charges from the E/M Coding viewer.\nCACTWO-4973 (Enhancement) Add arrows to move columns in ER E/M Configuration\nA new column called Move with up/down arrows have been added to drop down items in the Options section of the ER E/M Configuration page. This will allow users to arrange the order they want those items to display",

The admin staff can also see if they are meeting their goal for how many charts are outstanding at the end of the month. A comparison is displayed to show total charges for the current month compared to compared to the previous month.\nFiltering Discharge Not Final Coded (DNFC) This section can be filtered by facility and/or category. By leaving the filters blank it will combine all facilities and all patient types. You can use the filter to filter by a facility by clicking on the drop down or you can also include a category so that it only displays inpatient information.\nAvailable Defined as all patients discharged and not submitted within a coding worklist (Workgroup Type must equal coding) per either the “current month” or “previous month” depending on the column reported.

If the correct code appears in this list, clicking on it will add the code to the document.\nSupporting Evidence The supporting details help you understand why the engine suggested a code. If you click on the down arrow next to the code it will show you the words/phrases it is linked to, to create the code. This linkage will quickly tell you if the code is correct or if it tried to put two thoughts together that didn’t belong together. If you click on the down arrow next to the code it will show you the words/phrases is linked to, to create the code.\nAdd Code (via Direct Entry) Use Add Code when you know the code to be assigned and do not need the encoder.\nClick on the Add Code + sign to open the Code Editor window. Enter at least the first 2 characters of the code to bring up the drop-down listing of available codes for the main term, then scroll down the listing for codes to confirm the sub-term and select the appropriate code for complete coding.\nFrom the Code Editor window, you can also confirm the code description, set the POA Indicator, and designate the code as Admit, Principal or Secondary.\nAlternatively, you may also enter the text description of the code and select the code that way.\nCode Editor Window You can add either a Diagnosis or Procedure/CPT® code from the Code Editor window.\nAdd Code from Encoder You can add a code to a text document by highlighting the relevant word(s) or phrase and then right- clicking to open the Add Code menu.\nLeft-click and drag the mouse to highlight the selected text for code addition, then right-click to open the Add Code Menu.\nClick on the Add Code from Encoder + sign to launch the Encoder. Continue to use the encoder and accept the final code which will be returned to your chart\nAdding a Code to a Scanned Document Although the engine does not suggest codes from scanned documents, you can add codes to scanned documents for codes not assigned elsewhere within the chart.\nImportant Adding codes to scanned documents is recommended only when a code has not already been added to a text document within the chart or documentation to be coded is not found elsewhere.\nTo add a code to a scanned document, start typing the code in the Add codes drop-down box or click on the Encoder button in the bar above the scanned document.\nCodes added to the scanned document will appear in the Additional Codes box\nAdding a Code from Codebook You can add a code to a text document by highlighting the relevant word(s) or phrase and then right-clicking to open the Add Code menu.\nLeft-click and drag the mouse to highlight the selected text for code addition, then right-click to open the Add Code Menu.\nClick on Add Code from Encoder + to launch the Encoder. Continue to use the encoder and accept the final code which will be returned to your chart.\nAdding From Encoder Varies The exact functionality of adding a code from encoder can vary depending on your facility settings and the encoder used.\nPlease consult your manager if you need further instructions.\nEditing a Code To edit an existing or suggested code, left click on the code to bring up the encoder and Code Editor windows. If you are set up with dual monitors, you can move the encoder window to the second monitor and keep it open as you work through validation of each the engine suggested codes. From the Code Editor window, you can update the code from the code drop-down menu, via Direct Entry, or Encoder. You can also validate/update the POA indicator and validate/update the code status (Admit, Principal, or Secondary).\nIf you wish to change the code, place your curser in the drop-down box where the code you wish to change is displayed. You can remove, for example, the .9 and replace it with the code extension that you need vs. entering the entire code.\nIcon Description This button launches the encoder for the existing code Adds a new line for direct entry of additional codes Launches the encoder for selection of a code Saves any changes for the current session of Code Editor Closes window without saving changes from the current session of Code Editor Deletes the selected code from the chart You also have the option to minimize and restore the Code Editor window to continue viewing documents or other areas of the chart as you are working to complete additional details for the procedure code.\nIcon Description Minimizes Code Editor window so that the main screen can be viewed Restores the Code Editor window to full size for review and completion Adding Procedure Code Data Procedure codes typically require additional information for Physician and Date of Service for the procedure indicated along with procedure details. These fields are configured according to facility requirements and may look different in your version of Fusion CAC.\nTo enter in a date and physician to the procedure codes, right-click on the procedure code and then select Edit Procedure Info from the menu. After selecting a procedure code, the Code Editor window for the selected procedure code will open.\nAdd Procedure Date To enter the procedure date, start entering the date in MM/DD/YYYY format or click on the calendar to select the procedure date.\nAdd Physician To add the physician, click into the Add physician drop-down menu. Start entering the name of the physician who completed the procedure, then select the physician’s name to complete this field. You will need to enter in at least 3 characters of the physician’s last name to view the drop-down listing.

You can do this by clicking the Compute button and launching the encoder.\nCode Sequencing and Grouping through Encoder After clicking the Compute button, all patient demographic information and validated codes are uploaded to the existing encoder. Use the encoder to re-sequence codes, complete grouping, and complete the encoder session to return the computed grouping and re-sequenced codes to Fusion CAC. From here you will be directed to the Code Summary page for review of Validation Results (and resolution or errors), Assigned Diagnosis Codes, and Assigned Procedure Codes.\nCode Sequencing with CAC If grouping and billing edits are not required, codes can be re-sequenced by dragging and dropping codes within the Assigned Codes Pane.\nYou can click-and-drag codes within the list to re-sequence them.\nTruCode Resequencing TruCode users have the option to perform an encoder calculation without automatically resequencing the assigned codes on an as-needed basis.\nIn the dropdown menu on the right-side of the Compute button, the Compute w/o Resequence menu will perform the encoder computation but leave all diagnosis codes in their original position. This feature will enable sites to re-sequence codes above a certain position.\nPrincipal Dx Analyzer TruCode™ Users Only This feature only applies to TruCode™ users.\nMass Editing Codes Mass editing of codes can be accessed by right clicking and selecting Edit All Codes on any of the code headers such as assigned diagnosis, assisted procedures, admit diagnosis.\nEach code has a checkbox, and each section has an All checkbox. If the user clicks the All checkbox, a checkmark will appear in all codes under it, and any change made to one of those checked codes will be reflected in all other checked codes.\nUpdating PCS and CPT together Note that you can update PCS and CPT codes together. If there is a check mark, the change will be made to both the CPT and the Procedure Code. When both CPT and Procedure are selected together, only the Physician and Date can be changed.\nThe CPT code section has a Modifier column with a plus sign. Clicking the plus will open up the details window to add/change Modifier, plus other items that are included in that window. Clicking on the … symbol next to the Episode field will also open the details. You can add up to 4 modifiers, unless you are using the 3M™ Coding and Reimbursement System (CRS) which will allow you to add up to 5 modifiers.\nAdd Another Episode Right clicking on a procedure allows you at add another instance of the same procedure without needing to duplicate the effort of recoding the procedure.\nFrom Edit Procedure Info, you can also update additional information for the selection of procedure codes to add procedure date, add physician, and update additional details (for example, Anesthesiologist, Anesthesia Type, Tissue Sample, Procedure Location, OR Minutes). These fields are configured according to facility requirements and may look different in your version of Fusion CAC.",

If a user has at least one draft, but no sent queries, the total drafts count on their personal dashboard will display as zero.\nAlternatively, for organizations who do not have a physician query interface AND do not create a physician query until a response is received, a query can be created and not sent. When enabled, a physician query will show a “Continue” button in place of “Send”. Clicking the “Continue” button will refresh the query to open the physician response fields so that the query can then be closed.\nIf you want an automatic signature to be addended to the query you can add it within each users profile.\nPlaceholder Queries Some customers create a physcian query and then copy and paste it into a different system rather then send them through and interface this is called a place holder query for reporting and transparence of other users.

The bolding was intially added as an option for those sites to be able to tell what was keyed in by the end user appart from the template.\nQuery Status You can see the status of the query in the actions column on the query grid. The following are status options:\nStatus Defined Open This is a query that has been sent but not yet responded to by the provider. Answered This is a query that has been sent and has received a response but, it has yet to be closed by the end user. Cancelled This is a query that has been cancelled by the end user, you will see in the status column cancelled followed by the reason for the cancel such as created in error, wrong account, or others. Closed This is a query that has been closed by the end user, you will see in the status column closed followed by the outcome of the query such as agree, disagree, no option or no response. Closing a Query When you are ready to close a query, whether that be to review a response and update the outcome or to cancel a query, you can click on the envelope icon.\nUpon clicking on this icon, you would open the query to see the response from the provider if they answered.\nQuery Response Show Diff The physician query has a “Show Diff” toggle above physician query responses in the Physician Query dialog\nClicking it will show additional text in blue highlighting and deleted text in red highlighting. When the diff is shown, the button changes to “Hide Diff,” which when clicked will show the unaltered response.\nDiff False Positives If you have an interface that imports the physicians response the diff logic may report false positives and false negatives, like changes from double quotes to single quotes or the addition/deletion of blank lines.\nAfter reviewing the response, you can then close the query as agree, disagree, no opinion, no response or cancel if needed.\nDocumenting Shift Reasons Shift reasons can be categorized as either automatic or manual. In the case of automatic shift reasons, the following dialog box will not be visible. However, if you have enabled manual shift reasons, you will encounter the dialog box below. If you wish to enable or disable this feature, please contact CAC Support.\nUpon selecting an outcome for the query, such as “agreed,” and if your site has chosen to collect shift reasons, a dialog box will appear. This dialog box will display the pre and post-query DRG (if applicable) along with options for shift reasons. These shift reasons can be chosen by the end user to explain the rationale behind the change in the DRG. It’s important to note that changes in the DRG might occur for reasons unrelated to the query outcome. Please be aware that the shift reasons dialog is customizable, so your site may offer different options than what is shown in the screenshot below.\nQuery Impact Upon initiation of the query you will see a ‘Compute Button’ below the template name. Click to compute your Pre-Query DRG if there isn’t one already showing. By clicking this button, it will take whatever ‘Assigned Codes’ you have currently added to the chart to compute a DRG.\nOnce the pre-query DRG is completed you would follow the same process to send the query. Once the query has been responded to you would then open the query to complete and since we are capturing impact, you will now compute a post-query DRG. Likely the previous DRG would auto-populate unless you made changes to added, deleted, or changed any codes, re-sequenced or changed the discharge disposition. If there is no DRG then follow the same process you did pre-query.\nPost Query you will see a ‘Compute Button’ below the template name.\nClick to compute your Pre-Query DRG. By clicking this button, it will take whatever ‘Assigned Codes’ you have currently added to the chart to compute a DRG you can minimize the query and added, deleted, or changed any codes, re-sequenced or changed the discharge disposition then recalculate.\nQuick Complete The Quick Complete button is designed for sites that create placeholder queries ONLY. This feature allows a user to log a query without sending it externally. The query logging allows the user to assign a provider, template, reason, and both pre and post-DRG information along with closing the query with shift reasons all in one session. This quick complete button aims to streamline these actions into a single, integrated process. This feature is a new opt-in feature that needs to be turned on. Contact CAC Support to enable this feature.\nOnce enabled, create a new physician query, and notice a new “Quick Complete” button in the footer. Clicking it will automatically save the query and reopen it with “Record Physician Response” expanded to record a physician’s response. The “Quick Complete” button only appears on new queries, including queries opened from drafts. It will not appear if a query is edited or if a query’s physician is changed.\nPhysician Query Grid At the bottom of the Physicians \u0026 Queries page any query that was created will display whether you were the sender or not. If there is data in the table then there are queries that have been sent. If there are queries you will see the below grid. This grid will display information about when the query was created by whom, who it was sent to and if there was a reply and when. The actions column has 3 main actions; open which means that the query has not been answered, replied meaning that the physician has replied but the coder has yet to close the query, and Closed – meaning the coder has closed with an agreed, disagreed or no opinion status.\nChange Physician Queried This button allows you to change the physician if you sent the query to the wrong physician. Click on the Change Physician button and select the new physician. This will change the physician and open a Send New Query button next to the new name. Clicking this will cancel the original query and send the query out to the new physician you selected.\nPhysician Queries Not Always Cancelable Your site may not support canceling physician queries. If you redirect the query you may still have to cancel the query within the EMR; consult your manager to know if additional steps need to be taken to cancel the query in total to the originating physician.\nChange Physician and Date/Time on Query You can change the responding Physician since more and more are taking the “team” approach so that a patient can get quicker care without taxing a single provider. Whomever is on call will take care of the patient on behalf of the other provider and since the turn around reports are commonly tied a provider we want to ensure the correct responding provider will get the credit for a quick turnaround.\nHow can i change the responding provider?\nOnce a query is opened and responded or you decide to record the physician’s response on behalf of the physician you will see to by the provider you will see a section to select a physician and you can also update the date in time if you are manually closing queries so that the management reports reflect accurate turnaround times.",

Audit Executive Summary This report is an executive level view that shows an overview of inpatient and outpatient audit activity by Auditor. It includes the audit rate and average error rates for diagnoses and procedure coding. The date of this report is based on the date the account was first submitted.\nInpatient Audit Scorecard This monthly report provides a summary of the Auditor’s work completed for any type of inpatient audit and the financial impact based on the audit findings. This report will show number of coders and coded encounters audited that resulted in a DRG change and either over payments or under payments.

Only queries cancelled from within the Physician Query viewer will be tracked on this report, i.e. any third- party cancellations will not appear. Created date and cancelled date will be displayed, along with the amount of time the query was open. The date range for this report is the date that the physician query was cancelled.\nCase Mix Index Comparison Trend Report This report shows the Baseline, Working, and Final CMI per discharge month. (Filtering: Only run as a monthly report). The date range on this report is the Chart Discharge Date please note the range is expanded to the full month.\nCase Mix Index Report by Attending Physician Report This report will show the difference between the most Current Working CMI and Final CMI, additionally providing the CMI Difference (Final CMI – Current Working CMI.) This report will show how the physician’s documentation impacted the chart over the course of the patient’s stay. If the physician documented appropriately, the Current Working and Final DRG should be very close. If the DRGs are far apart, the likely cause is that either the CDI did not have the documentation, or the physician did not document the chart comprehensively. This report should be used in conjunction with additional auditing on the attending physician if you are questioning the results. (Filtering: Only run as a monthly report). The date range for this report is on the Chart Admit Date\nCase Mix Index per Month Date Range: Chart Discharge Date (only Submitted Inpatient charts with a DRG Weight valued will appear in this report) This report will provide a monthly case mix overall for all financial classes then for each financial class. This report is based upon final coded outcomes. A “case mix index” is the average DRG Weight of accounts that have a DRG Weight - This report only includes submitted inpatient accounts with a DRG Weight.\nTotal Groups Totals are displayed differently based on the facility filter and the number of facilities returned by the report.\nIf there is no filter on facility and more than one facility is in the report, an additional “All Facilities” group is appended that calculates the case mix for each financial class across all facilities. If there is any filter on facility and more than one facility is included in the report, an additional “Combined Facilities” group is appended that calculates the case mix index for each financial class across the filtered facilities. If only one facility appears in the report, there is no “All Facilities” or “Combined Facilities” group. Blank Field Values Blank facilities or financial classes are displayed as an empty string to be consistent with other reports.\nCC/MCC Capture Rate This report provides the final outcome of CC/MCC capture rate. This can be used to compare the CC/MCC capture rate to those DRG’s that don’t have a DRG but, have the opportunity to be maximized which is defined as DRG’s with a DRG description of without CC/MCC, w/o CC, w/o MCC. This report will tell you what opportunities may have been missed\nCDI Detailed by Review Type Report This report provides details about the type of CDI reviews performed by account. The date range of this report is the Chart Reviewed Activity Date. To qualify for this report the chart must have at least one CDI review.\nCDI Executive Summary Report This report is an executive level view broken down per month that shows total discharges vs. total reviews in addition to the # of total queries, response rates and improved DRG’s. The improved DRG is calculated by determining if there was a positive reimbursement gain from the baseline to the working DRG. (Filtering: Max of 12 months selected; only run as a monthly report). The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date, please note that this report date range is expanded to the full month\nCDI Financial Benefit Report This report is broken down per month coded and the total financial impact CDI had on the chart. The report will only display charts with unmatched DRG’s and show a financial impact based on the baseline DRG to final coded DRG. The date range on this report is the Chart Submitted Date (LastSubmitter).\nCDI Metric Score Card This report shows CDI productivity based upon the CDI user reviews and queries. The report will show CDI activity specifically on the number of initial reviews (first time a CDI reviews a chart), number of follow up reviews (reviews beyond the first time a CDI reviews a chart), queries issued, agreed upon query amounts, and the number of days we show activity occurring.\nCDI Productivity - Admission Month Report This report shows CDI productivity based upon the admission month of the patient. The report will show CDI activity specifically on the # of initial reviews (first time a CDI reviews a chart). A review is calculated by the following:\nInpatient: First time a user with a role of CDI computed a Working DRG and saved the chart. Outpatient: First time a user with a role of CDI saved the chart. This report will also tell you out of the charts the CDI staff member completed what the query rate is and on average how many days did it take before the chart was initially reviewed. Reporting is done on the admission month, so this report displays any patient discharged or not discharged during this admission month if there was a CDI review. (Filtering: Only run as a monthly report). The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date, please note that this report date range is expanded to the full month.\nCDI Productivity by Review Type Report This report shows productivity by each user by review type. The date range on this report is the Chart Reviewed Activity Date. To qualify for this report the chart must have at least one CDI review.\nEnable Viewer To access this report you must enable the Documentation Reviews viewer for CDI.\nCDI Query Detail Report This report provides details of physician queries created by CDI Specialists on accounts that have since been discharged. This report details how the account evolved from a Baseline DRG to a Final DRG.\nNo PDF Support Due to the number of columns, this report is not intended to be launched as a PDF.\nAny non-cancelled physician query created by a CDI Specialist on an inpatient, now-discharged account should appear as a line item on this report.\nCDI Query Score Card Report This report is displayed in several sections:\nDischarge/Reviews – This section reports on the review rate of the CDI team. It displays the number of patients discharged in the current month along with how many of them were reviewed by CDI. CDI Query Outcome – Of the charts that made up the review rate under discharges, this section displays the total that resulted in queries that are broken down more granularly by the physician’s response rate. Reconciliation – This section displays charts that created the review rate section and have a final DRG without having a submitted status. This section shows how often CDI and coders agree on the DRG. CMI Comparison – This section reviews where the chart started (Baseline DRG CMI) and where the chart ended up (Final DRG CMI – which is the reported CMI). (Filtering: Max of 12 months selected; only run as a monthly report). CDI Team Metrics - The calculations within these sections are like the existing fields in the CDI Metric Score Card report, but the review counts are determined by the discharge date or admit date of accounts, respectively The date range on this report is the Chart Discharged Date, please note that this report date range is expanded to the full month\nCDI Rounding Report This report shows all charts reviewed and not reviewed by CDI. If the account has not been reviewed by CDI, working information will be blank to allow CDI to take notes while rounding. If the account has been reviewed by CDI, this report will show an account level view by admit date of the difference between the ALOS and the GMLOS based on the most current Working DRG. The variance is the difference between ALOS and the GMLOS. The higher that number, the chart is identified as needing a re-review for potential DRG change and SOI/ROM. The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date. To qualify for this report the chart must be an Inpatient Chart.\nCDI DRG Report This report shows all unsubmitted inpatient accounts without a discharge date that have a calculated Suggested or Working DRG and all diagnosis codes used in that calculation, ordered by Room # from the location. Only the most recent Suggested or Working DRG is displayed for each account. The GMLOS will only display if the DRG was computed by a CDI Specialist; it will not display if the DRG was computed by the Suggested DRG module. The date range input below is irrelevant for this report and will always display all inhouse patients.\nNot Available For Scheduling This report is not available within Scheduled Reports.\nCDI Activity Report This report shows the number of ‘Initial Reviews’ vs ‘Followup Reviews’ per category (patient type) with the total number of queries sent. (Filtering: Max of 31 days selected). The date range on this report is the Chart Working DRG Save Date/Time (Query Create Date for the Queries.)\nCDI Codes on Submitted Charts Report This report shows the list of diagnosis codes and procedures that CDI assigned in sequenced order.\nNo PDF Support Due to the number of columns, this report is not intended to be launched as a PDF.\nCoder DRG Summary This report is to show the breakdown per coder MS-DRG to show the total visits per DRG.\nEngine Outcome Summary by Coder Report This report can be used to determine how the engine performed for the coder. It shows whether they leveraged the code suggestions or if they manually entered codes, bypassing suggestions. Data is gathered based on the date the chart was coded, and is based on final codes, not working. This report should be used in conjunction with a coding audit if needed.\nAccepted: A code suggestion was assigned directly to the account. Added: A code was added to a text document manually and assigned to the account. Added Text: counts the number of codes added to phrases in text documents that were not suggested by FAE. Added Non-Text: counts the number of codes added to the top of text documents and worksheets that were not suggested by FAE. Edited: A code suggestion was edited and then assigned to the account. Direct: A code was assigned directly to the account manually or from the 3M CRS encoder, but also suggested by FAE Image: A code was assigned from an image document. Image (Non-Duplicate): counts the number of codes added to image documents not suggested by FAE. Image (Duplicate): counts the number of codes added to image documents that were also suggested by FAE. The date range on this report is the Chart Submitted Date (FirstSubmitter.)\nCoded Procedure Account Details Report This report provides details about charts with assigned procedures. The date range on this report is the Chart Last Submitted Date. To qualify for this report the chart must have at least one Procedure code assigned on the chart.\nNot Available For Scheduling This report is not available within Scheduled Reports.\nCoder Activity Report This report shows the distinct number of accounts that were ‘Viewed’, ‘Saved’, ‘Submitted’, and ‘Resubmitted’, then the total number of Queries created, the total time updating, time viewing accounts, and total time spent per day - grouped by coder then by category (patient type) over the date range. Date Range is the date of the activity, beginning of start date to the ending of end date. (Filtering: max of 31 days selected). The date range on this report is the Change History Audit Date (Viewed, Saved, Submitted, Resubmitted actions.\nCoder Detailed Activity Report This report is very similar to the “Coder Activity Report” but with two notable changes:\nThe new column “Chart Touches” counts the number of times the user touched\" an account on a specific date. A touch is defined as a unique save or submit action. The times submitting and times saving are split. If the user loads an accounts, saves it, keeps the account loaded, and then submits it, the time between loading the account and saving it counts as time submitted instead of time saving. Physician Coding Activity This report shows the distinct unique charts a physician coder viewed and how many changes were submitted and pended, then the total number of Queries created, the total time updating, time viewing accounts, and total time spent per day - grouped by coder then by category over the date range. Date Range is the date of the activity, beginning of start date to the ending of end date.\nCoding Chart Status Report This report displays coding productivity in regard to submitted, pending, and unbilled charts. This report shows how long the chart took to code from the time the patient was discharged and how long the chart took from the time the coder had accessibility to the patient chart. Once a patient is discharged, it may be examined for completeness and non-coding staff may place pending reasons on the chart to indicate deficiencies. When the deficiencies are resolved, the chart is then assigned to a coding worklist to indicate the chart is ready for coding. The date range on this report is the Chart Discharged Date\nDischarged Not Final Coded Report This report will show management all of the discharged charts within the system that do not have final coding. The date range for this report is the Chart Discharged Date. To qualify for this report the chart must have a status of Unbilled. If there are multiple pending reasons on a qualifying chart, they will be separated by a comma.\nDRG Comparison Report This report shows the difference between Baseline DRG and Final DRG per account. Only accounts that have both a CDS calculated Baseline DRG and a Coder Submitted Final DRG with an Admit Date within the selected range will be included. The user(s) selected below will constrain the data to either (or both) by the CDS on the most current calculated Baseline DRG or the Coder that last submitted with a Final DRG. (Filtering: Minimum of 1 category selected). The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date.\nEngine Outcome Detail per Coder This report should be used to show if the user is using code suggestions or manually adding codes. It will show total assigned codes broken down by code set along with how many codes were suggested by the engine versus added by text documents and non-text documents in addition to those that were added in duplicate. This report card should be used as an educational opportunity to show possible improvements for the end-user and/or code suggestions. This report is recommended to be used in conjunction with an audit.\nDocuments without codes not included in total The field “Total Documents” had to be constrained to count the total documents on the account with at least one attached code to make the formulas correct. Documents with no codes (suggested nor added) are not counted in this report (and shouldn’t be since this report is about engine outcome).\nEngine Outcome Detail per CDI This report shows the total codes that the engine is suggesting, and what CDI is using vs. what CDI is manually adding compared to the coder’s Final Codes. This report should tell the level of manual effort per CDI of those codes that are being used for final code assignment by coders. It will show total assigned codes by CDI broken down by code set along with how many codes were suggested by the engine versus added by text documents and non-text documents in addition to those that were added in duplicate. There is also a column to indicate of the codes manually added how many did the coder assign for final code assignment. This report card should be used as an educational opportunity to show possible improvements for the end-user and/or the code suggestions. This report is recommended to be used in conjunction with an audit.\nEngine Results by Documents Report This report shows the default engine accuracy per document at the time of submission. Also, shows the first and last times the document was received on the submitted accounts. The report is sorted from most to least added/edited codes by the coder. The date range on this report is the Chart Submitted Date (FirstSubmitter).\nFinal Class Outcome by Discharge Report This report shows the breakdown per financial class per month. It will breakdown the total patient charts, average length of stay total charts and case mix index.\nFinal Code Count per Account Report This report shows the submitted chart high level outcomes for diagnosis and procedure codes per account. The Total Dx column displays the total of unique diagnosis codes on the account (visit, admit, principal and secondary); the # of DX Unspecified column shows how many of those codes are showing an ‘unspecified’ designation in their description. This report will allow managers to target coder audits to determine if the chart is being coded correctly or if additional data should have been requested through a query. This report would be used in conjunction with an audit. The date range on this report is the Chart Last Submitted Date (Must have a status of Submitted.)\nGlobal Productivity Report This report shows coder productivity by patient type per day, the number of ‘Viewed’, ‘Saved’, and ‘Submitted’ actions, and the total time logged working on that patient type. (Filtering: Max of 31 days selected). The date range on this report is the Change History Audit Date (Submitted, Resubmitted, Saved, Viewed actions.)\nHAC Report This report is to provide a listing of all patients admitted within the date range of this report that contains hospital acquired conditions. This report only looks at final coded data and does not reflect working data. The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date.\nIncentive Productiviy Report This report applies an incentive multiplier to the distinct number of accounts that were first submitted each week, per user, to calculate incentive points.\nMultiplies the number of first submitted accounts per week by an incentive multiplier per category that is configured in Mappings Configuration. The administrator can optionally record an incentive multiplier that is used in this report. Categories without a value in the incentive multiplier will be calculated with an incentive multiplier of 1.0. This report is like the “Weekly Coder Productivity Report” in that it reports on whole weeks, but only produces an entry if the coder first submitted an account that week. Length of Stay Variance Report This report shows an account level view by admit date of the difference between the ALOS and the GMLOS based on the most current Working DRG. The variance is the difference between ALOS and the GMLOS. The higher that number, the chart is identified as needing a re-review for potential DRG change and SOI/ROM. The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date (Must be an Inpatient Chart).\nMatched Suggested DRG Outcome Report This report examines the Suggested DRG History to the earliest date/time that a Suggested DRG matched the Final DRG on an account. The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date. To qualify for this report the chart must be an Inpatient Chart with Stage of Submitted,Discharge Date and Final DRG.\nInpatientDateTime field This report supports a new optional “InpatientDateTime” field if present on the account. The “InpatientDateTime” field is the date/time in which an account became an inpatient account – common for sites that change outpatient accounts to inpatient accounts. If this field is not present, the AdmitDateTime is used.\nOutstanding Queries Report This report displays a list of the physicians that have open queries. At the top of the report there is a summary that shows the Top Physicians with outstanding queries and the length of time their oldest query has been open. Date Range: Query Create Date (The date that the query was initially created and sent).\nPending Reasons Report This report shows which charts are pending, who placed the pending reason, what the pending reason is, and which physician was assigned to the pending reason. Not all pending reasons will have a physician assigned as some pending reasons are not a result of chart deficiency. The date range on this report is the Chart Admit Date.\nQuery Impact Report This report includes all charts that received queries and resulted in at least one of the following:\nA change in DRG Change in CC/MCC/HAC Totals Other reasons your facility has defined as a query shift reason This report will show you the impact that the query made. The report is grouped by query template name, then by Author, then by account #. The query will also show if there was a shift in DRG and what the user listed as the reason for the shift. The date range on this report is the Query Create Date (The date that the query was initially created and sent)\nQueries with same DRG \u0026 No Shift Reasons Not Included By design, the Query Impact Report only reports queries that had an impact by either having different before-and-after DRGs or by having shift reasons. The queries not displayed in the Query Impact Report had identical DRGs and no shift reasons, so they were excluded. Hence, the name of the report – Query Impact Report.\nQuery Impact by Discharge Date Report This report includes all charts that received queries and resulted in at least one of the following:\nA change in DRG Change in CC/MCC/HAC Totals Other reasons your facility has defined as a query shift reason This report will show you the impact that the query made. The report is based on the patient’s discharge date and is grouped by query template name, then by Author, then by account #. The query will also show if there was a shift in DRG and what the user listed as the reason for the shift. The date range on this report is the Chart Discharged Date.\nQueries with same DRG \u0026 No Shift Reasons Not Included By design, the Query Impact Report only reports queries that had an impact by either having different before-and-after DRGs or by having shift reasons. The queries not displayed in the Query Impact Report had identical DRGs and no shift reasons, so they were excluded. Hence, the name of the report – Query Impact Report.\nQuery Overview Report This report shows pre-discharge physicians query response or non-response and the template used. The date range on this report is the Query Create Date (The date that the query was initially created and sent).\nQuery Stats Report This report shows the physicians within the date range that were queried. The report will show how many charts the physician was queried for and how many queries these charts resulted in.

Procedure Codes Added This is the count of the total of added or assign actions by the auditor for principal and secondary codes once the auditor selects the update codes button. The assign action is defined by right clicking on a code from the unassigned code tree and selecting assign as principal or secondary, right clicking on a code to validate from a document or adding a code that did not exist previously. Principal PCS Changed This is a true or false field. If the principal PCS was changed from the previous code assignment the field will result in true which is counted as one error and if it was not changed it will result in false which is not counted as an error. N/A is available in the event the auditor wants to list it as not applicable to the audit. Procedure Errors This is the total codes that appear in the above boxes the formula is as followed: Procedure Errors = Procedure Codes Added + Procedure Codes Edited + Procedure Codes Unassigned + Principal PCS Changed. Procedure Error Rate This is the total codes that appear in the above boxes the formula is as followed: Procedure Error Rate = Procedure Codes Added + Procedure Codes Edited + Procedure Codes Unassigned + Principal PCS Changed/ Procedure Codes Pre-Audit. Procedure Accuracy Rate This is the total codes that appear in the above boxes the formula is as followed: Procedure Error Rate = (Procedure Codes Added + Procedure Codes Edited + Procedure Codes Unassigned + Principal PCS Changed/ Procedure Codes Pre-Audit) – 100%.",

There are two styles of impact that can be reported which are:\nChart Impact Query Impact These are both reporting separately as you could be query positive impact regardless of if the chart has a positive, negative or neutral impact. The baseline is defined as the DRG that would have been coded and billed if no CDI specialist reviewed the chart.\nYou can report the impact of a CDI specialist by measuring the difference between the baseline DRG and the billed DRG because of your organizations policy that the last know working and final DRG always match, I we measure impact on last known working and final your impact would always be neutral if we measure baseline which by default is the first DRG you calculate unless the baseline is readjusted you may claim to much impact therefore the baseline throughout the patients stay is commonly readjusted. While the baseline DRG may seem like a simple concept, it can at times be difficult to determine. Here is an example:\nA patient is admitted through the ER after presenting with undiagnosed abdominal pain, which would result in DRG 392 with an estimated reimbursed of $5,008 . After further testing, it is revealed the abdominal pain is the result of acute cholecystitis; this changes the DRG 446 (disorders of the biliary tract without complication) with an estimated reimbursement of $5,175 . CDI documents an increased creatinine and a decreased glomerular filtration rate and queries the physician regarding the patient’s renal status. If the doctor provides proper documentation, it could be possible to assign a code indicating a complication for Stage IV chronic kidney disease, which would result in DRG 445 (disorders of the biliary tract with CC) with an estimated reimbursement of $7,464 . The patient undergoes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, changing the DRG to DRG 418 (laparoscopic cholecystectomy with CC) with an estimated reimbursed of $11,868 . Next, the patient develops shortness of breath, and the consulting cardiologist documents acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure, changing the DRG to DRG 417 (laparoscopic cholecystectomy with MCC) with an estimated reimbursed of $17,478 . Normally, instead of the Baseline being DRG 392 which is the first listed, would adjust to would be readjusted to DRG 417 once the patient goes to surgery. If the patient had not gone in for surgery the baseline would have remained DRG 392 .\nHowever, none of the CDI impact is lost though because queries are counted separately if you run the query report that CDI would:\nQuery Impact (Difference between DRG 446 and DRG 445 = $2289) Chart Impact (Difference between Baseline DRG 417 and Final DRG 4117 = $0 What I listed above is how some organizations do report not all of them through do this, the choice is up to your organization. To remind you that your baseline may need updated you can turn on a feature that upon save it displays a message asking the CDI user if they would like to update there baseline DRG if the last computed working DRG is different than the baseline. Remember you only want to move the baseline when the baseline needs reset such as a patient going in for surgery, if you constantly update the baseline you will show no or little impact. The goal is to show the impact of your work.",

This document will appear in the Documents pane with white text against a black background. Bookmarks on those documents will also be retained. Doing a Ctrl Click on the document header in the viewer will now show the archive date and time. Text Document Visual Differences The ability to see the differences between two documents has been added. This is for text only document; attempting to use images or manual documents will result in a red toast message advising the user to use a different document.\nTo see differences, the user must first open a document. Next, they will right click on another document in the document tree and select View Diff from the menu. This will bring up a new tab. The left side of the tab will show the older document, and the right side will show the newer document. The older document will show strike-outs wherever something was changed, and the right side will show blue highlights for anything that was added. In the example, an older Consultation document is being matched against a newer Consultation document.\nSearch Button The Documents pane includes a Search button. Click on the Search button to open and enter the specific terms or phrase to be found within the documents in the chart. After pressing the Enter key, documents that include the searched term or phrase will be highlighted in RED .\nClick on the document highlighted in RED to view the searched term/phrase within the document. Each occurrence of the searched term/phrase will be highlighted in yellow.\nUpon clicking the search button, a floating window will now open and will fill with all results for the search word.

Coders can view the patient chart. In addition to, adding, deleting and changing both codes and DRG’s on the coding abstract. They can also add and remove from any coding forms in addition to accessing any available editable fields in account information and they can add any notes and bookmarks. CDI Specialist can view the patient chart. In addition to, adding, deleting and changing both codes and DRG’s on the CDI abstract. They can also add and remove from any CDI forms in addition to accessing any available editable fields in account information and they can add any notes and bookmarks.

They cannot add notes, make changes to codes or DRG’s. Read Only users do not have access to the administration application. Router is a role that is accompanied by either the coder, physician coder or CDI specialist role. This allows the user to route to other users, they can either save and route to a user or workgroup overriding the natural automatic workflow of the system. Primary Workgroups This field is a list of check boxes that are populated based on the queues that are created in the ‘Automatic Assignment’ tab. By checking these boxes, you are giving that user access to queues\nBackup Workgroups These workgroups are only visible to the user from the Account List page if all other assigned queues are empty. As soon as an assigned workgroup receives an account, the backup queues are no longer visible. Auto- Download will not be affected.\nGroup ID This field allows you to enter in a user’s group ID.\nActive This field allows you to provide or revoke access to the system. If checked the user is active, if unchecked the user is inactive and will not have access to the system.\nLocked If a user has been locked out of the system due to, too many login attempts they might be locked out, if you check the box the user will be locked out of the system and the user will not be able to login until this box is unchecked.\nSave User Button This button allows you to save the user profile you are adding or editing\nCancel This button allows you to cancel the user you are adding or editing without making or saving any changes.\nUsing Force AutoLoad This feature allows you to reduce cherry picking allow you to force ordering of the workgroups and the order in which patient charts are severed to the end user. If checked, then when the user logs in, the user will skip the Account List page and they user will be presented with an AutoLoad page. To get the next account they will click on “Go to Next Account” by clicking this button it will automatically load the first account from the assigned workgroups based on sort ordering set by the manager skipping charts that another user already has locked.\nIf there are no accounts left, the system will automatically load the first account from the visible linked workgroups. If there are no accounts left, the user will be presented with a new screen informing the user that there are no accounts.\nSetting Limits on the Number of Charts Users that are configured to have Forced Autoload will now have an column under the Workgroup assignement panels. This will allow managers to limit the amount of accounts in each workflow that the forced user will be assigned. If limit is left as blank the user will not have a limit and to move to the next workgroup the workgroup will need to be depleated.\nIn the instance below, I have set limits on the users accounts they can code out of each workgroup. Therefore even if the CDI NLP workgroup has 20 accounts in it, the user will only be able to complete 2 charts until the user has worked through all of the other assigned workgroups. So the user will receive 2 CDI NLP accounts, then up to 5 Surgical Testing accounts, and then up to 3 Clinic accounts. When the user has reached the end, the work starts back at the top again with up to 2 CDI NLP accounts.\nManual Routing Always Takes Priority If an admin routes a chart directly to the users “You” worklist, the chart will appear next in autoload before resuming normal workgroup priority order.\nThe “autoload” page provides a copy of the Coder Personal Dashboard. The coder will also see a list of accounts they saved with a pending reason at the bottom of the autoload page that they can access by clicking.\nUser Profile The users profile can be reached from the top right corner of the application or by using user management. By clicking on the user name you can click on the verbiage of profile to open the users profile. Depending on the permission the user has will depend on the settings available in the users profile. In addition clicking on the user name you will be able to see the users productivity stats for today.",

That information is displayed in the Admit Dx Code field.\nCategory A category is a ‘Dolbey’ created field that is used to further specify a patient type, if applicable. At some sites, category might equal patient type while others may have a category that is comprised of multiple fields to create that category. For example, if you would like to report on how many charts a coder completed for inpatient and then define them by LOS, you then have a category to define the difference between LOS patient types or service lines.\nInpatient 1-10 LOS Inpatient 11-20 LOS Inpatient 21 + Outpatient Radiology New Review Date Next review date is set either automatically by the system or manually by the CDI if they choose to override the system automatic default date. The default date is whatever your management team has selected as a default interval for follow up reviews to occur. This may mean that the default is set for the next business day or two days later. This field is can be manually overridden by a CDS in the Code Summary viewer. Why would a CDS manually override this field? If you have reviewed the chart and know the patient is going to have surgery in a few days and there is no reason for a follow up review based on your sites policy’s. You may choose to augment the next review date for after the scheduled surgery.\n30 Day Readmit This field is an optional feature add-on that a site can see if the patient has been readmitted within 30 days of the admit date. This field will populate with the previous account number, thus you can report on data to see if accounts exist with this data.\nBaseline Baseline is defined as the baseline data of the chart that would have been coded and billed without the intervention of the CDI staff. This data is used to measure the impact that CDI has on a patient’s chart is then measured as the difference between the Baseline DRG and the Billed DRG (either the weights or the reimbursement).\nWorking Working is defined as the working information due to the intervention of the CDI staff. The CDI staff will update this information concurrently until the patient is discharged with additional data surrounding presenting problems or provisional diagnosis.\nFinal Final is defined as the coded data added to the chart be billed out.\nReconciliation Reconciliation typically refers to a process that occurs when the working and final DRG’s do not match. Charts get flagged with a field called ‘Is DRG reconciled’. If there is a check mark then the chart has been reviewed and the chart has been reconciled either as an agree to disagree or agree and an adjustment is made to the working or final DRG once CDI and/or Coding does another review.\nDRG Reconciled? Reconciliation typically refers to a process that occurs when the working and final DRG’s do not match. Charts get flagged with a field called ‘Is DRG reconciled’. If there is a check mark, then the chart has been reviewed and the chart has been reconciled either as an agree to disagree or agree and an adjustment is made to the working or final DRG once CDI and/or Coding does another review.\nDocument Type The document(s) that are present on the patient account. The document types for searching and/workflow are required to have the interface name, not the friendly name. If you do not know the document names that are available to use, Dolbey can provide a table which provides this information. Send an email to results@dolbey.com requesting the document table names.\nAssigned Assigned means that the code was used for billing purposes. If you are looking for codes that are suggested or added by CDI for working/baseline purposes you would use the document code. Note: If designing workflow it is recommended this field is used for CDI, but for QA purposes its recommended that ‘Assigned’ is used to ensure you are QA on what was billed vs what was suggested.\nDocument Code Document Code is defined as any code on a chart whether manually entered, Suggested. The code can be unassigned which means it’s not used for billing or assigned which is used for billing. Note: If designing workflow it is recommended this field is used for CDI, but for QA purposes it’s recommended that ‘Assigned’ is used to ensure you are QA on what was billed vs what was suggested.\nPhysician Queries Open Physician Queries Open is the number of physician queries on the account that have not been closed. A physician response could have been received, but if it hasn’t been viewed by a user within CAC, the physician query is still considered “open”.\nPhysician Query Total Physician Queries Total is defined as how many queries a chart has on it regardless of whether the queries are opened or closed. If a user was in an account that had an open physician query, and an external interface closed that query, the query total on the account is updated upon closing the account.\nWorkgroup A list of charts to be completed for coding, CDI or QA.

    "content": "Fusion CAC suggests a DRG on inpatient charts. This Suggested DRG is computed by the system within a set interval (typically every six hours of the patient’s admission provided there is enough documentation to suggest codes used to compute a DRG).\nThe Suggested DRG is then re-calculated every six hours until discharge or a CDI Specialist or Coder computes a DRG. At that time the Suggested DRG is discontinued. The Suggested DRG along with other data elements are not commonly used within Fusion CAC, rather this data is sent outbound to be used by other healthcare professionals ,such as physicians and case managers, to predict the number of days that the insurance (payor) will pay for the patient to stay within the hospital based upon the current diagnosis of the patient. The common data element used by case management and physicians is called the GMLOS (Geometric Means Length of Stay).\nHow does suggested DRG work? The suggested DRG module leverages the codes that are suggested by the FAE engine. The FAE engine collects all codes suggested along with the section header that it was extracted from. The diagnosis codes are then compared against a configuration file called “Invalid Headers”. If the diagnosis came from a section header within this file it is discarded from consideration for the principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis code commonly is the driver of the DRG category; thus, the section of what diagnosis is named principal is crucial in the success of the Suggested DRG. Once the codes have been picked through for candidates, the codes are then passed through a modeling system to select the principal diagnosis based upon historical data that the model has been trained upon.\nWhy do we discard diagnosis from being candidates for a principal diagnosis? A patient’s chart contains a lot of information including historical information that is relevant for the patient’s chart, but should not be considered as a principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis can be defined as primary diagnosis to which the majority of the resources were applied or the main reason the patient was admitted. The “invalid headers” that are thrown out include medical history, problem list, social history, and family history, among others.\nHow is Suggested DRG displayed with Fusion CAC? It is displayed within a viewer called Suggested DRG. This is housed under the navigation tree and displayed for users to see the timeline of the suggested DRG and how it evolved overtime. Below is a screenshot of what the suggested DRG viewer looks like within the navigation tree. By clicking on the blue header the tree will expand and show the coder along with the principal diagnosis that was selected.",

    "content": "The workflow management editor is a tool that allows users to create, design, modify, and manage workflows. A workflow is a series of tasks or activities that need to be completed in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome.\nWhat is the purpose of workflow? The purpose of a workflow is to systematically organize and streamline the patient chart activities for proper completion. Workflows are designed to improve efficiency, productivity, and collaboration between CDI, Coding, Quality and Auditing by defining the sequence of steps, assigning responsibilities, and establishing the flow of information between different individuals or departments involved in the process.\nOverall, workflows play a crucial role in enhancing operational efficiency, consistency, collaboration, and overall effectiveness within organizations. They ensure that tasks are completed in a structured and efficient manner, enabling organizations to achieve their goals more effectively. In Fusion CAC each workflow is configured with pieces of Criteria. Criteria is what causes a workflow rule to fire, either by creating a field equal to, contains or does not contain. Often a workflow will contain a Criteria with many different filters within it to ensure we constrain the data with enough detail, so all charts do not get caught in one Workgroup.\nNew Workflow Editor The new workflow management page is listed as “workflow management”. Fusion CAC offers two options for workflow management: the “workflow management” and “workflow management classic” designs. While both pages offer similar features, the new workflow management page includes additional functionalities that are not available in the classic version.\nWe understand the importance of a smooth transition, so we will be maintaining the new workflow management system for a few releases. To accommodate your preferences, we have implemented a convenient option to switch between the classic view and the new page display. This way, you can transition gradually and comfortably, choosing the workflow management system that best suits your immediate needs.\nTo simplify the transition process further, we have imported all your existing workflows into the new workflow management system. This means any changes made in either of the pages will be reflected in the other, allowing you to become familiar with the enhanced features and maximize the benefits they offer. The new workflow management editor offers several enhancements, including:\nImproved Vertical Viewing Space for Workgroups: This display offers a better vertical viewing space, enabling workgroups to access and manage their workflows more efficiently. Side-by-Side Comparison of Workgroups: Users can compare and analyze workgroups using a convenient side-by-side comparison feature Filtering Ability to Search Workgroups by Specific Fields: This feature allows users to filter and search for workgroups based on specific fields, making it easier to find relevant information. This filter is “smart” no matter the operator you use if you indicate Building = Rad it will find any workgroup that has the building with rad regardless if its equals or in list. Cleaner/Sleeker Look and Feel: We have focused on creating a cleaner and sleeker design to enhance the overall user experience. Classic Workflow Editor Workflow Categories The categories are defined as:\nAutoClose This is a process by which an ancillary patient chart can be auto closed based upon a set of rules without coder intervention. Autoclose is a process that takes somewhat “simple” outpatient visits and automates the coding process by submitting the chart directly to billing. You may also know this as the industry term autonomous coding.\nThis automation allows for the handling of a lot of the simple high volume outpatient visits with little to no human intervention. Many organizations are turning towards AutoClose to ensure they can capitalize on the low hanging fruit of these ancillary chart types while not sacrificing the staff they have.\nPatient charts that pass AutoClose criteria are coded and submitted to billing, while those that fail AutoClose are rejected and routed to a worklist for coder intervention. Charts rejected are presented to the coder with a failure reason.\nYou can start AutoClosing charts right away. However, many organizations want to see how the engine functions before AutoClose is enabled. Autoclose has a test mode which allows you to simulate what would have AutoClosed had it been turned on in production. This allows users to review and determine if AutoClose is ready for production.\nNo matter when you start, it is recommended to begin with specific accounts. The best early candidates are lab, screening mammogram, outpatient therapies (physical, occupational, or speech therapy) and other accounts that do not require an interpretive report.\nThe types of accounts will depend on your organization, the type of services you offer, your payor, and state requirements. Common outpatient service lines to implement in addition to the early adapters listed above include:\nScreening Mammogram Sleep Lab Labs Chest X-rays ED Left Without Being Seen Canceled Accounts Cardiac rehab Dietary or nutritional counseling Esophageal motility studies Outpatient dialysis Pulmonary function tests Vaccine visits As you expand your AutoClose capabilities we recommend you conduct regular audits to make sure your system captures and codes everything correctly.\nWith AutoClose, charts can be processed within seconds and the total turn-around time can be a little as a few minutes. Charts are processed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year with AutoClose. This allows you to, essentially, gain a coder that doesn’t have sick days or take vacations. This means that charts can be submitted to payors sooner which accelerates time-to-cash.\nThe impact AutoClose can have on revenue is one of the best benefits of this feature. Many organizations AutoClose, on average, 10,000 or more charts per month. This equals out to about 120,000 outpatient visits AutoClosed per year without coder intervention. That is an estimate of 2.5 FTEs.\nCDI/Concurrent This type of workflow is ONLY valid if a patient chart does not have a discharge date and has a status of unbilled.\nPost Discharge This type of workflow is ONLY valid if patient chart has a discharge date and has a status of unbilled.\nQA Review This type of workflow is available for any charts you may wish to QA. This is also used for reconciliation workflow.\nCustom This type of workflow was designed to allow custom categories to meet unique client requirements.\nAudit This type of workflow is available for any charts you wish to audit. This workflow can be used to define certain days for when charts would get added to the Auditor worklist(s).\nExample: Select that workflow automatically adds charts to the worklist on the first day of every month and last day of the month.\nOn these designated days every month, 5 charts (the number of charts can be changed) from every coder (First Submitter) will be automatically routed to the auditor’s worklist. You can define the auditor’s worklist by specific patient type (category) and/or service to automatically route into the worklist for a designated date range.\nFor example, on the 1st of the month auditors would want charts from the previous month from the 15th day to the last day of the month. Those 5 charts from each coder should be from different dates within the date range defined so that all of them don’t come from the same date. Then on the 15th day of the month it would pull from the 1st day from the 14th day to the last day of the month.\n“Audit” is a default workgroup category to appear above AutoClose (keep the default categories alphabetical). Like all other workgroup categories, the “Audit” workgroup category will have workgroups containing criteria groups. In Workflow Management the “Audit” default workgroup category is identical to all other workgroup categories, but Audit workflow is triggered on a schedule instead of in real-time.\nWhen Audit workflow is activated based upon the schedule configured within the workflow, it will grab accounts based on the criteria filters, group them by one or more fields, then select x number of accounts from each workgroup.\nWorkflow Management Workflow Management (Classic) Each criteria group of an “Audit” workgroup will have additional data elements to record\nSchedule The schedule on which Audit workflow will run (Daily, Weekly, or Monthly).\nGroups One or more single fields to perform the grouping. For example, a grouping of “Last Submitter” and “Is Inpatient” would tell Audit workflow that after gathering the list of accounts, group them by unique Last Submitter + Is Inpatient.\nLimits The number of accounts to assign from each grouping. This value can be a maximum number, a percentage, or both. Using the example grouping above:\nSetting the selection to 10 maximum with no percentage means that for each unique group of “Last Submitter” and “Is Inpatient” accounts, assign randomly up to 10 accounts. Setting the selection to 50 percent and 10 maximum means that for each unique group of “Last Submitter” and “Is Inpatient” accounts, assign randomly 50% of the accounts but up to 10 maximum. Setting the selection to 50 percent with no maximum means that for each unique group of “Last Submitter” and “Is Inpatient” accounts, assign randomly 50% of the accounts.\nCustom Category The “Add Category” button is located on the Workflow Management page to allow for the addition of custom workflow categories.\nThe default categories will continue to work as they currently do; an account can only be in one default category (AutoClose, CDI/Concurrent, Post Discharge, QA Review).\nWith the addition of the new custom categories, an account can exist in one default workgroup and can co-exist in any of the custom workgroups. An Add New Category button appears at the top of the screen.\nUpon clicking this, the box will open for the use to type in the category name. Once a name is typed in and OK is clicked, the Add New Category and Create New Workgroup buttons will disappear, the new category name will then appear in the Category box, and next to that will be the usual box and button to create a workgroup\nCustom categories will appear in their own section on the Workflow Management page, below the default categories. Custom categories allow an account to be in multiple custom categories at the same time.\nSteps to Add Workflow in Classic mode Start by clicking on “Create New Workflow” Select Category of “Post Discharge” Name your Workgroup something short and that will be meaningful to the end user such as “Inpatient” or “Inpatient with Charges”. This tells the user what the workgroup contains. Select “Create Workflow” Add yourself for testing purposes to the work group in the “Users” field. Then click Add Criteria Group. Name your Criteria a short phrase in which describes the reason this criterion will move charts into the workgroup then hit enter. This will help with troubleshooting in the future. Then click on the criteria name and click “Add Filter” and select “Set Property…”. The property are database fields. Add as many properties as needed to ensure you filter the data down so the appropriate charts make it into each queue. One you add a property you will be presented with a set of operators; depending on the property you select the operators can be different. Assign workgroup type, this will signify if it’s Coding, CDI, Auditing, Quality or Support. This helps to classify the worklist charts are sitting in for the chart status report. Steps to Add Workflow Start by clicking on “Create New Workflow” Select Category of “Post Discharge” Name your Workgroup something short and that will be meaningful to the end user such as “Inpatient” or “Inpatient with Charges”. This tells the user what the workgroup contains. Select “+ Add Post Discharge” the name may be something different than post discharge that is the name of the workflow category Add yourself for testing purposes to the work group in the “Users” field. This can be found in the properties section Assign workgroup type, this will signify if it’s Coding, CDI, Auditing, Quality or Support. This helps to classify the worklist charts are sitting in for the chart status report. Then click Add Criteria Group. Name your Criteria a short phrase in which describes the reason this criterion will move charts into the workgroup then hit enter. This will help with troubleshooting in the future. Then click on the criteria name and click “Add Filter” and select “Set Value…”. The property are database fields. Add as many values as needed to ensure you filter the data down so the appropriate charts make it into each queue. One you add a property you will be presented with a set of operators; depending on the property you select the operators can be different. Workgroup Level Criteria A new option for workgroup level criteria has been added to Workflow. It works like all other criteria. When you click on it, it allows you to add criteria that will be used for every group under that workflow. This will alleviate the need for the user to add the same criteria to all of the workgroups.\nAs an example; the user has created 3 criteria under the workflow name Auditor. A Workgroup level criteria of admit date is created.\nThe user can click on every criteria in that Workflow name of auditor and check the box to use the workgroup level criteria.\nWith the box checked, workflow will now apply that Admit date time to that particular filter’s criteria. This will help keep repetitive criteria creation to a minimum.\nAND/OR Criteria Workflow has two different options to build workflow.\nAND criteria OR Criteria. Example of AND Criteria At the end of each criteria you add an “AND” (see below). This criterion will cause the chart to fall into the Inpatient Surgery worklist if the has a patient type of Inpatient AND the patient has been discharged AND the patient has a hospital service of SUR.\nExample of OR Criteria At the end of each criteria you will add an ADD or an OR see below). This criterion will cause the chart to fall into the Inpatient Surgery worklist if the has a patient type of Inpatient AND the patient has been discharged and the patient has EITHER a hospital service of SUR OR the Documents must include an Operative Report or OP Note. The OR criteria is listed in blue to call attention.\nWorkflow History Edits The display for Workflow Management has been changed to allow for an onscreen running history of edits. Users and Linked Users will now be seen under the name of the workgroup and will be defaulted as collapsed. Clicking on the link will toggle the box open.\nAny change made to criteria will show as a time stamp on the criteria bar next to the specific criteria that was changed. The date on the criteria bar will always be the latest change date.\nHovering over the date will give detailed data for that specific date change. If multiple changes have been made to a workgroup, clicking on the date in the criteria bar will open a box listing all changes for that workgroup.\nWorkflow Operators Operator Description Equals This is used if you have one value, and it must equal the value. This is case sensitive. \u003e This sign means that the value must be less than the value noted. \u003c This sign means that the value must be greater than the value noted. \u003e= This sign means that the value must be less or equal to than the value noted. \u003c= This sign means that the value must be greater or equal to the value noted. In List If you have more than one value, it could be any of the following. Not In List If you have more than one value, you do not want it to equal. Contains If you have a word, phrase or value that can contain it must have what you added exactly. This is common when including payors. Only Contains Any one of the codes it is not needed to do all 3. Exists This will search to see if anything “exists” in this field, if it’s not blank it will match. No value is needed after the operator. Does not Exist This will search to see if anything “does exists” in this field if it’s blank it will match. No value is needed after the operator. More Than This operator is only used with date fields, you will need to define “more than” how many days ago. You cannot add a date into the field as this field will need to be dynamic therefore days ago is used. Less Than This operator is only used with date fields, you will need to define “less than” how many days ago. You cannot add in a date into the field as this field will need to be dynamic therefore days ago is used. Later Than This operator is only used with date fields, you will need to define the exact date you do not wish to exceed. Is On This is for an exact date, this is uncommon to use for workflow. Includes Each Of If you have more than one value, it must contain all of the following. However, note the chart must have each of the values but can also have other values. Includes Any Of If you have more than one value and it could be any of the following. Does not Include If you have more than one value, you do not want it to equal you must use “Not In List” Random Audit The criteria filter, “Random Percentage” is included in the workflow criteria options. When set to a number between 0 and 100 and detected in the workflow engine, a random number will be generated. If the random number is less than or greater than the number in the filter criteria, the Criteria will match.\nRandom Inclusion Factor that is less than 20 will pass a theoretical 20% of accounts through the filter. You don’t want to use this with equals (=) because it would always cause a ~1% result, and you don’t want to use it with greater than (\u003e) because it will pass an inverse percentage.\nAs noted, this is not going to be an exact percentage, only a theoretical one. In edge cases, you could ask for “20% of accounts” and end up getting zero, or you could end up getting all of them, but most of the time, you should get ~20%.\nThis field is intended to be used with QA Workflow, although the application won’t prevent an administrator from using it in other types of workflow. Valid values for this field are from 1 to 99; any other values in this field won’t work.\nDo not think of this field as a percentage, but rather as a 100-sided die. When workflow examines this filter, it’ll “roll the die”. The common use case for this filter is “Random Inclusion Factor –\u003e less than –\u003e 10”.",
    "description": "The workflow management editor is a tool that allows users to create, design, modify, and manage workflows. A workflow is a series of tasks or activities that need to be completed in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome.\nWhat is the purpose of workflow? The purpose of a workflow is to systematically organize and streamline the patient chart activities for proper completion. Workflows are designed to improve efficiency, productivity, and collaboration between CDI, Coding, Quality and Auditing by defining the sequence of steps, assigning responsibilities, and establishing the flow of information between different individuals or departments involved in the process.",

The discrete values show trending data or data that has values. The most common examples of discrete values are lab values and vital signs.\nOnce you have clicked on Discrete Values or the Flow Sheet Viewer from the navigation tree you will be presented with one of the two views depending on your desired configuration during the project.\nFlow Sheet Viewer The flowsheet viewer is the most recent style of discrete data viewer. This viewer is organized much like a spreadsheet. Depending on your configuration, you may see major categories on the left-hand side of the spreadsheet telling you lab power forms could be vital signs. (There are many different options as each site is a little different.) Upon clicking on one of these items you will be presented with a grid to the right. That grid will have multiple columns, the first column being name if you hover over the column name you will see three little lines if you click on them, it will allow you to filter so that you can narrow down the data. If any of those names appear in red that means that at least one of the data elements are outside of the normal limits if there is a range.\nTo the right of the name you will see, if applicable, a reference column. This reference column will tell you if the value is within normal limits. This is data that your EMR system has sent to the CAC system. If the reference column is available, then to the right of that you will have a flag column. I A checkmark in that field also means the value is out of the normal range to provide an additional indicator than just the red coloring on the name. This column can also be filtered if you wish to look at everything outside of the normal limits. Next to that field you will be presented with a date and time column, and you may see multiple dates and times depending on how the data is organized and how frequently it is documented.\nIf a discrete value on the Flowsheet viewer has a specimen, it will show as a beaker symbol in the Results column. Hovering over the symbol will provide the name and site of the specimen.\nCollapsing/Expanding If you right click in the Major Category column will show a menu allowing the user to expand or collapse all categories. That configuration will be saved for all accounts that have the Flowsheet viewer, per user role. Note that if a user collapses/uncollapses a major category in the pop out, it will not be seen on the main page until the user moves to a different viewer and back.\nDiscrete Values Viewer An older style of discrete data can also be displayed in a discrete values viewer where you may see tab across the top to display the categories of data. This displays each of the types of discrete data elements your site has; however, your site might have different topics than the screenshot.\nThe Discrete Values viewer will display a Filter by Month box, listing the months that contain values. Selecting a month will highlight all the corresponding dates in the Filter by Date box. The resulting values will show in the viewing pane. The Normal and Abnormal tabs both have this functionality and are filtered separately.\nDiscrete Values with a grey header are within normal limits, your organization sends what is the reference point to determine what is normal and what is abnormal. If a header is display in red, it’s considered abnormal by your organization. In addition to the header color, you can tell if the value is out of normal limits as there is a flag that indicates if the value is low vs. high.\nPop-Out Window The flow sheet viewer or discrete data viewer can be popped out into another window by clicking on the icon in the navigation tree next to the flowsheet or data viewer name.",

In order to send the charges outbound there is a check box at the bottom of the viewer “Send Charges Outbound” then you must click save or submit. Once charges are sent outbound the viewer text will return to the default color (black).\nPlease note that this feature is optional and requires configuration to enable the sending of charges outbound.\nPhysicians \u0026 Queries The “Physicians \u0026 Queries” viewer will be highlighted with an amber background in the Navigation Tree if the account has at least one physician query CACTWO-6136\nBackground Color Precedence The amber background does not appear if the “Physician \u0026 Queries” viewer is selected because the “selected” background overrides the amber background.\nCode Summary (Navigation Pane) Red: The code summary will turn red if there is a validation rule error or warning present. Once the validation rules are resolved the viewer text will return to the default color (black).\nBlue/Red Circles that contain Numbers: These circles with numbers next to each code are the Risk of Mortality (ROM) and Severity of Illness (SOI) which can be values 1-4, this information comes from the APR-DRG which is a priority grouper licensed from 3M GPCS.\nP Icon: This indicates the diagnosis is a principal.\n1-3 Numbers in Visit Reason Section: This indicates the position number of visit reason.\nValidation Results (Code Summary) Red: This color is associated with validation hard stop used to notify a user that there may be things that they need to resolve. It does prevent the user from submitting the chart.\nYellow: This color is associated with validation soft stop used to notify a user that there may be things that they need to resolve. It does not prevent the user from submitting the chart.\nDocument Tree White Paper Icon: This icon means that the document is a text based document and may be eligible to receive code suggestions.\nCamera Icon: This icon means that the document is a scanned document and is not eligible to receive code suggestions.\nPink: Documents that arrive late are highlighted in pink, alerting the end user that these documents were not accessible during the coding process. These documents were added to the patient chart after the submission.\nBlack Background: This color indicates the document has been archived which means that the document was removed or replaced on the account and that the end user had already added codes or bookmarks on the document.\nRed Text: The red text on the document name is displayed when you use the search and what you search for it finds the word/phase in a document it will highlight the documents in red to call attention to them.\nGrey Circle with Number: The grey circle with a number on the document name is displayed when you use the search and what you search for it finds the word/phase in a document it will highlight the documents in grey circle with the number indicates the number of instances that word/phrase is within the document.\nSquare with arrow symbol: This symbol is used if you want to pop out the documents into a separate tab.\nAqua Background: This color indicates this document has been popped out into a different tab.\nDocument Pane Words/Phrases and Codes can be highlighted in few different colors:\nBright Yellow: Words/Phrases and Codes can be highlighted bright yellow when you either click on the code from the unassigned or Show all panel linking you to the code location within the document. It can also result in yellow if you user uses the search feature to search on a word or phrase you will notice the words will highlight yellow in the document.\nGreen Highlight: This color is used when a code is validated by an end users on a different document other than the one you are looking at, this allows the end user on subsequent document to quickly see what was already validated. Green is also used by CDI Alerts which highlights words and phrases used to pull details out to link to text for clinical evidence for CDI Alerts.\nCaution Yellow: This color is associated with caution codes which indicates when the system suggests codes that are flagged as cautionary. Caution codes are applied to documents that the management team has identified as requiring careful consideration. These cautionary documents enable the system to suggest codes that may not be present on provider-facing or coder- codable documents. It’s important to note that these codes cannot be validated from these documents alone.\nFor instance, if a nurse mentions that a patient was treated for respiratory failure, but there is no mention of it by the provider, the caution code serves as a reminder to ensure that no relevant information is overlooked. It acts as a safety net to capture potential discrepancies or omissions in the documentation process.\nGreen Paper Icon: This means that a bookmark has been added by an end user. If you hoover over this you can see the note or if you go to notes \u0026 bookmarks within the navigation tree you can see all that were placed.\nGreen Flag: The green flag next to the code within the document and is shown on the show all or unassigned code tree this indicates there is a comment on a code. The code comment can also be found on the notes \u0026 bookmarks under the navigation tree within the code comment section.\nAudit Worksheet Red: The red indicates that there is an open audit.\nBrown: The brown indicates that there is a closed audit.\nAsterisk Symbol:\nP Icon: This indicates the diagnosis is a principal.\n1-3 Numbers in Visit Reason Section: This indicates the position number of visit reason.\nComment Icon: The comment icon allows auditors to enter in notes next to any of the codes or items getting audited on the coder or auditor tree.\nBlue background: Accuracy rate lines have a blue background, so they stand out.\nCode Tree H Icon: This icon indicates that the code is an HCC.\nMCC: This indicates that the code is an MCC.\nCC: This indicates that the code is an CC.\nHAC: This is returned upon computing for the MS-DRG indicates that the code is an HAC.\nNOR: This indicates the procedure code is a non-OR procedure.\nTag: This is returned upon computing for the MS-DRG indicates that the code is the culprit to one of the following quality measures PSI, PDI, PC-06 or Elixhauser.\nPurple Background on Assigned Codes: This means that there are more than 25 codes and any code in purple is below the the 25th position. This is important since CMS only accepts 25 diagnosis codes in the event you need to consider resequencing codes that need to be above the 25th position.\nExclamation Icon: This will appear on the “show all” tree when a user manually entered this code and the system suggested it.\nPerson Icon: A user manually entered this code. It was not suggested by the application. Hovering over the icon will display the user who added it.\nCaution Symbol: The caution symbol next to the left of the code is a edit that comes from the TruCode encoder or add on edits. If you hoover over the caution symbol you can see the edit, if you need a larger view of the edit you can open the TruCode research page for further details.\nGreen Flag: In the “Show All” or “Unassigned Code Tree,” the presence of a green flag next to a code signifies that there is a comment associated with that particular code. This same flag can also be found alongside the code within a document and in the notes \u0026 bookmarks section under the navigation tree within the code comment section.\nPencil Icon: The pencil icon is exclusively available on non- TruCode sites, allowing end users to manually input a code into the encoder using the compute button. This signifies that there is no direct association between the code and any specific location on a document.\nLetter Blocks: The letter blocks next to each of the diagnosis codes indicate the present on admission (POA) status. When clicked the end user can change the status to the following:\nY = Yes N = No U = Undefined W = Withdrawal E = Exempt Notes \u0026 Bookmarks (Navigation Tree) Red: The red indicates that there are notes, bookmarks or code comments.\nPhysicians \u0026 Queries (Navigation Tree) Red: The red indicates that there are answered queries awaiting review. Brown: The brown indicates that there are open queries awaiting an answer\nCharges (Navigation Tree) Caution Symbol: The caution symbol next to the left of the code is a edit that comes from the TruCode encoder or add on edits. If you hoover over the caution symbol you can see the edit, if you need a larger view of the edit you can open the TruCode research page for further details.\nCDI Alerts (Navigation Tree) Paper Icon: The paper icon allows users to click to enter notes to indicate thoughts on the CDI Alert.\nFor Example, a user may want to indicate they are “Watching the alert because they want to wait for a consult to occur the next day to decide if a query is needed.”\nRed with Number: The red indicates that there are “Active CDI Alerts” and the number represents to total active alerts.\nDashboards Blue Text: Most of the blue text on the dashboard is a clickable link. When clicked it will open a new tab into a pop out with the details behind the number. There are some numbers like numbers with a percentage rates or averages that won’t yield pop out results.\nTuning Dashboard (Tuning Menu) Star Symbol: The star symbol can be found in the tuning dashboard when clicking on a numbered result. This represents the charts that an user accessed. The tuning team uses this to keep track of the cases they have reviewed and those they have left to review.\nRight Corner (Anywhere) Question Mark Icon: This icon represents the help menu that you can find the user guide, hot keys configured for your site and more. This icon can also have customized links for the site and if this is needed a ticket can be logged with development\nBanner Bar ROM or SOI: If these number are in red it means that the ROM or SOI on the score is high (either a 3 or a 4)\nG/LOS or ALOS: If these are in green it means there are still days left in the patient stay and red means they have exceeded the days.\nDRG: if the DRG is red it means that a mismatch occurred where the CDI and coder do not match either the exact DRG or if the DRGs are the same the DRG weight is different this can occur on APR-DRGs. If the DRG is green it means the DRG’s matched.",

Start by selecting the level of the rule on the left-hand side.\nThe levels are defined as:\nError - This validation rule must be resolved before the user can submit a chart. Typically, this type of rule only applies to a coder because CDI specialists do not typically submit charts. This validation rule appears in a red color, indicating there is a hard stop. Critical - This validation rule is the same as an error, with an additional warning. If, upon clicking save, the end-user still has a critical error, they will get a pop-up box that indicates they still have validation rules outstanding and asking if they wish to continue. This validation rule appears in a red color, indicating there is a hard stop. Warning - This validation rule is a soft stop used to notify a user that there may be things that they need to resolve. It does not prevent the user from submitting the chart. This validation rules appears in a yellow color, indicating there is possible intervention needed. Toast Message - This is a notification that comes from the top right-hand corner of the browser as a red notification that is presented for a few seconds. Toast messages do not stop the user from submitting or saving a chart. It is simply a notification message to alert the user. Disabled – This will disable the validation rule and turn the rule within validation management red to show it is not active. Defining the Criteria Once you have selected the level of the validation rule you want to create, you must define what the criteria is starting with the verbiage you want to display to the end user. For example, you can display an error if a chart does not have a discharge disposition, so it doesn’t get submitted to billing without one. Since we would want to warn the coder and not the CDI specialist, we would add another criterion input so user role is not equal to CDI specialist. First, type in the display name, which is displayed for the user on the code summary so keep it simple but provide how they fix the error.\nExample: D/C Disposition must be present - The end user would know they have to add that to continue.\nType of Criteria Once you have created the rule name, click on Add Criteria to define how the system fires this rule. Upon clicking on Add Criteria, you will be presented with types of criteria.\nAccount – Account type criteria allows you to select fields for a patient chart/account such as discharge date discharge disposition, admit date, procedure codes, diagnosis codes, and many others.\nUser - User type criteria allows you to restrict the rule to a certain users role, such as a coder or a CDI user role only. Commonly, an account criterion and a user role will be used together, however account level criteria can be used independently from the user role. It does not, however, make sense to create a rule on a user role and not define any other account level criteria.\nOnce you have defined the type of criteria, you can then add the details.\nExample: ERROR: D/C Disposition must be present\nBuilding criteria for a validation rule is much like workflow. For this example, select account, then in the field name find Discharge Disposition. Once you drop in the field name, it will then give you other fields. In this example it allows you to select an operator.\nAND/OR Criteria Validation Rules, much like workflow, has two different options to create a validation rule.\nAND criteria OR Criteria. Example of AND Criteria At the end of each criterion, you add an “AND” (see below). This criterion will cause the validation rule to display if the patient has both a newborn Z code AND an admit type of 4.\nExample of OR Criteria At the end of each criterion, you add an “OR” (see below). When you add an OR criteria it will turn blue to differentiate between the first and second statement. This criterion will cause the validation rule to display if the patient has either a newborn Z code OR an admit type of 4.\nOperator Description Equals This is used if you have one value, and it must equal the value. This is case sensitive. \u003e This sign means that the value must be less than the value noted. \u003c This sign means that the value must be greater than the value noted. \u003e= This sign means that the value must be less or equal to than the value noted. \u003c= This sign means that the value must be greater or equal to the value noted. In List If you have more than one value, it could be any of the following. Not In List If you have more than one value, you do not want it to equal. Contains If you have a word, phrase or value that can contain it must have what you added exactly. This is common when including payors. Only Contains Any one of the codes it is not needed to do all 3. Exists This will search to see if anything “exists” in this field, if it’s not blank it will match. No value is needed after the operator. Does not Exist This will search to see if anything “does exists” in this field if it’s blank it will match. No value is needed after the operator. More Than This operator is only used with date fields, you will need to define “more than” how many days ago. You cannot add a date into the field as this field will need to be dynamic therefore days ago is used. Less Than This operator is only used with date fields, you will need to define “less than” how many days ago. You cannot add in a date into the field as this field will need to be dynamic therefore days ago is used. Later Than This operator is only used with date fields, you will need to define the exact date you do not wish to exceed. Is On This is for an exact date, this is uncommon to use for workflow. Includes Each Of If you have more than one value, it must contain all of the following. However, note the chart must have each of the values but can also have other values. Includes Any Of If you have more than one value and it could be any of the following. Does not Include If you have more than one value, you do not want it to equal you must use “Not In List” Once you have selected the field and your operator add a value.\nExample: ERROR: D/C Disposition must be present We might select Does Not Exist as an operator. This would mean if a discharge disposition does not exist, then this rule would display on the code summary and prevent the user from submitting the chart.\nAdditionally, we may only want to display this rule if the user has a role of a coder. To constrain the rule further, click on the Add Criteria again, select user, and then select “Is not CDI Specialist”. This will prevent the rule from display to a user with a role of a CDI.\nFor Each Check Box For each is used for fields that are repetitive. For example, a field like discharge disposition is a single field (there are not multiple discharge dispositions on a patient chart) therefore, you do not need the “for each” checkmark.\nThe For Each checkmark makes sense when you’re trying to create a rule that would have multiple outcomes, such as checking if any diagnosis codes have a POA status of U. We don’t want to check only the first diagnosis rather we want to check all diagnosis to see if it has a status of U. For Each can also be used if you want to check if a procedure code has a date of service and/or provider attached. We don’t want to just check the first procedure code for the date of service, we want to check each of them.\nTo use this field, first select For Each before defining a field. The system will open another drop-down field to the right of For Each to indicate where you want to create the rule. There are only a handful of fields the For Each field make sense for: charges, CPT codes, diagnosis codes, procedures, pending reasons, and physicians.\nOnce you have selected a fields, you need to define the field you are looking for. Example: Place an error reminding the coder to add the POA status on any diagnosis code that has a U Click on For Each, then select diagnosis codes. Select POA from the field drop-down menu which will allow you to review operators. For this example, use the operator of Equals. Once you select the operator of Equals, then you have a field to fill in the value, which would e be “U” in this example.\nThen, because it makes sense to direct the coder to where the diagnosis code was validated or added, we can then select Navigate to document code and it will take the end user back to the documentation so they can review and assign the POA status appropriately.\nAdding fields to a rule You can add fields to the rule to tell the user exactly what POA is triggering this rule so they don’t have to look through all of the codes to determine which one has a U status.\nYou can inject a field within the rule that will be displayed for the end-user. Do this by putting the field name in braces exactly like this {Code}. When the rule fires for the end-user, it will display the code with the issue. If there are multiple, use the For Each field to see each of the codes that are the issue as an individual rule.\nNavigate To Once you have defined your rule, you will want to decide if it makes sense to take the end user somewhere in the software to correct the issue based on the rule created. In the example of a discharge disposition, it does make sense to direct the user to go to the account information page as that is where they would likely change the disposition. Under where you selected the level, there is a field for\nNavigate to (these are placed within the patient chart, under the navigation pane).\nNone – Will not take the user anywhere if they click on the error/warning. Charges – Will take the user to the charges viewer. Account Info – Will take the user to the account information viewer. Document Code – Will take the user to where the code was validated/added. Physicians \u0026 Queries – Will take the user to the Physicians \u0026 Queries viewer. Pending Reason This field will have a dropdown with all available pending reasons. If a rule is triggered on an account and it has a pending reason attached, then the pending reason will be added and the user will be able to see the number of the rule. Pending reasons that have a physician or date requirement will NOT be available in this list. The only way to remove a pending reason that was added by a rule is to have that rule cleared\nSaving your Rule Once you’ve completed adding criteria for your validation rule remember to click on Save Rules in the top right-hand corner. It is recommended that you test your validation rule by opening a chart that fits the criteria of your validation rule",

If you need more information on the set up of this page, please contact the SME Team (smeteam@dolbey.com).\nThe ER E/M Configuration can be found within the Tools menu. If enabled, you will see it beneath the Validation Management.\nUpon clicking on ER E/M Configuration, you will be presented with the configuration page which should look similar to the below.\nWithin the configuration page, you can configure the E/M Level Matrix and other components. If a user has a Facility Mapping, the EM E/R Configurations can now be copied between the various facilities. If the user has a Facility mapping, a new option will appear in the top right of the screen allowing selection of one of the facilities. Once a facility is chosen, that facility’slevels will appear. A new Copy button will show at the top of the Levels section. Clicking it will open a dialog asking the user what facility to copy those current levels to. The levels will be presented in a dropdown. In this case, I am in Dolbey South – Cincinnati, and when I select the copy button, I have the option to pick another facility to copy those levels to:\nThis option will overwrite and copy the current levels that are onscreen to the facility that is selected. If the user does not have a Facility mapping, then these copy options will be hidden.\nConfiguring the E/M Matrix The table below shows how the E/M Matrix will display to the end user. You can configure the verbiage on this table to control what is displayed for end users.\nThe E/M Coding Matrix has horizontal columns which display the E/M Level across the top. Below each level are selections that make up the level. There are a few categories under each of the levels which, by default, include the following topics:\nMode of Arrival Disposition Testing Medication Behavioral Procedures Other Criteria Under the levels, you will have seven topics that drive each of those levels. These topic names are configurable, as some of the default topics may not pertain to your facility.\nEach of the topics under the levels will have a list of items that are applicable to the topic and the corresponding level. However, this E/M Matrix configuration will allow you to change the content within each of those fields underneath of the corresponding E\u0026M level as your facility may have different items to list under each code, per topic.\nTo make changes to the default you can click on the grey number to open the matrix configuration.\nOnce you have opened the number, you will see each of the levels with corresponding codes. Next to each of the levels under Level Topic you will see a +Add button. Clicking on this +Add button will allow you to add another selection. Clicking on this button, display an open text field where you can type in what you want the choice to be. Remember this verbiage should be short and simple.\nYou can also remove selections under each topic and level by selecting the X button. This will remove the selection.\nYou can also change the default verbiage we provided by simply placing your cursor into each topic and level. You can remove or change any of the verbiage that is in these fields\nConfiguring Charging Options and CDM Below the E/M Matrix configuration you will see a section for “Other”. The other section allows you add in charging components attached to a charge master. To make changes to the default, you can click on the grey number to open the charge and CDM configuration.\nThe effective date field the date on which the CDM table in the new charges once you open up the table will take effect. This way, if you have a new updated CDM table or if you were trying to plan for the future you can stage when these tables are available to the Coding Team.\nUpdating the CDM Click on the green “Edit CDM Table”button to the right of the effective date.\nBy clicking the button it will open up the edit CDM table this is asking for you to paste from your Excel spreadsheet.\nBest practice is to paste in the CDM column, then the description, then the CPT code. This step is extremely important because any assigned CDM will need to be sent in the outbound interface, therefore, your CDM table needs to match whatever is going to be downstream from Dolbey.\nOnce you paste it in the information, click on the update button to ensure the preview looks correct. If so, click on the OK button to continue.\nOnce you’ve dropped in the CDM table you can now edit the categories within the option section. There are a few different default options:\nTrauma No charges Medication quantity Medication time/modifier Additional charges To edit any of these options you can click on the gray date next to each of these options to open them. Some of these options may not pertain to you. If so, you can remove all the options underneath the sections and that section will be removed from the E/M coding page for your users.\nTrauma Section When you open the trauma section, you will have an item name. Some data will be defaulted here. Each of these items have a CDM attached per E/M level, including critical care. Ensure that the CDM underneath each of the levels corresponds to what your CDM table indicates.\nFor your end users this will be a drop-down menu. For example, when the user selects Pre-Hospital Notification, they do not have to select the E/M level. Based upon the matrix and what they selected, it will drop in the associated CDM code based upon the level they have assigned.\nCaution If your CDM changes, you will need to update this table as well.\nNo Charge Section Once you have reviewed the Trauma section you can then click on the gray date next to no charge. This option is set up a little bit differently. The item field will be the verbiage that you want to correspond to the CPT code to the right.\nFor your end users, this box will drop-down. The user will choose the item and in the outbound interface we will drop in both the CPT code and the corresponding CDM code that you have listed in this table.\nMedication Quantity Once you have reviewed the No Charge section you can then click on the gray date next to Medication Quantity. Within this section you can list the item name in which we had provided a default description, these items will match to corresponding CPT and CDM code\nThe medication quantity as well as the medication time modifier is not about the medication. rather the way the medication was administered. This allows you to charge for any injections, infusions, IV pushes, immunizations, and hydration. The medication administration quantity allows you to define how many of each occurred on a particular date, if the ER visit occurred over more than one day, and other modifiers which can be added as needed.\nTo the end-user this looks like a table where they can pick all the medication administrations to apply and provide dates and modifiers. There is a section for the end users to enter a note to keep everything in line so that they can indicate which medications they have already charged for. This helps the end- user keep their thought process together, and also provides information in the event that there is an audit.\nMedication Time/Modifier Medication administration time/modifier is very similar to the medication administration quantity. The only difference is that you are able to indicate that there are, for example, multiple infusions. If there are different drugs involved you can copy the individual lines so that you can add in the durations of each medication along with the date and modifier if the modifiers are different.\nSome organizations like to have medication administration quantity and medication administration time/modifier, however, other organizations will relocate all of the items within the medication administration to the medication administration time/modifier section so that all medications are within the same section.\nWithin this section, you can list the item name in which we provided a default description, these items will match to corresponding CPT and CDM codes.\nTo the end-user, this looks like a table where they can pick all the medication administrations to apply and provide date and modifiers. There is also a section for the end users to enter a note to keep everything in line so that they can indicate which medications that they have already charged for. This helps the end-user keep their thought process together, but also provides information if there is an audit. There is also a copy button to the left of the note that allows the end user to copy if there are more than one medication that needs to be considered.\nAdditional Charges This allows you to enter in some of the things that are common to be charged for within the ER. We have indicated that there are four common ones however, you can add as many as you like by clicking on the plus add button. You can also remove any default items if you do not charge for these by selecting the delete button next to the defaults provided.\nWithin the section you can list the item name in which we had provided a default description, these items will match to corresponding CPT and CDM codes.\nTo the end-user this looks like a table where they can quickly add a quantity, date, and modifier if any of the default charges are applicable.",

In Mapping Configuration, if you add or edit a mapping for “Payor”, you see a new “Default Bill Days” field in the header and a new “Bill Days” column for each Payor.\nThese fields contain numbers zero or higher or blank to indicate the number of days to add to the discharge date (current date is there is no discharge date) to calculate what is basically a billing due date.\nThe billing date is compared to the current date (or the last submitted date if the account is already submitted) to compute the “Billing Countdown” – the number of days left to submit an account. If an account has no payor, no matching payor mapping, or payor mapping with no “bill days” defined, the “default bill days” is used (zero if “default bill days” is blank as well.)\nYou will find a new field, “Billing Countdown,” that you can add from Grid Column Configuration, to use for account search filters and workflow. A use case for this field is to determine which accounts are approaching a due you can do something like this",

For example, CDI Worksheets are used for a CDI to document their thoughts while reviewing a chart.\nQuery templates are frequently created and saved as a base template with most of the query written to show as read only text. The creator can then add open fields for the user to add additional questions to the base query template.\nTo add a form, simply click on the +Add button in the section you wish to add a new form to, or you can click on an existing worksheet or query to edit the template.\nCreating a New Worksheet/Query To create a new form, first start by entering a document name; name the worksheets or queries unique for reporting purposes, then you can start designing.\nYou can start with a document that you have already created. Copy the text and paste it into the form designer. You may have to change the formatting once pasted depending on the document format you copied it from.\nAny text you copy or type into a form will be read only to the end user creating the form it’s a template they will follow. However, you can create fields that they can enter information into the form by clicking on Add Field will present an updated dialog that includes a new “Account Field” type.\nIn this dialog, the field name should be unique, so you can do reporting. You can also make fields required by checking the box or not if it’s optional. After clicking OK, another dialog will appear to select the field to display. After selecting a field, a box will display in Form Designer as a placeholder for the field that you selected. Chose the type of field that makes sense based on the form.\nIn the Physician Query Dialog or in a manually added worksheet within an account, the placeholder will be replaced with bolded text representing the field’s actual value\nCreating a Blank Query Template If a Physician Query is exactly called “Blank Query Template” in the Form Designer then an additional ‘Query For’ field will appear for the user to enter plain text. In applicable reports, the Query template column will show “Blank Query Template”: followed by the value for the ”Query For” field.\nVerbal Query You can request with CAC Support a verbal query template that will not be sent outbound. CAC Support can add logic into the script so that when a template named “VERBAL QUERY” is used it will not be sent outbound to the provider. To ensure you can still report on the topics of the query we would recommend creating a template using the exact name “VERBAL QUERY” and then select the check box Add Field For ‘Query For’\nIf this box is checked, when the end users use this template to record the verbal query outcome they will be presented with a box to add in what the query was for, it should be something like Sepsis or CHF that follows the normal template names so the reporting is still available.\nCreating Dynamic Sections What is a Dynamic Section? This allows users to create a template for the user creating the query to customize the query by removing sections as needed from the template or to rearrange the order of information.\nThe Field Name will be displayed in the template above its section. Text and fields can be inserted into a section; sections cannot be inserted in other sections. When the template is added to a query, each section will now show an up and down arrow for movement, along with an X to delete that section from the query.\nOnce sections are created, they will look like the below within form designer:\nOnce sections are created, they will look like this when a user created a query within an account\nA user can move sections up or down, or remove sections. If you remove a section you will be presented with an undo button to place it back into the query.\nCreating Internal Notes Internal only notes can now be added to Physician Query templates from the form designer. On a template, clicking the Insert dropdown will now show a new option of Add Internal Note. The Internal note is only displayed for the user filling out the query and is not set to the provider receiving the query.\nSelecting this option will add a highlighted free text line to the document.\nWhen adding a physician query the user will see the highlighted section in the query when that template is selected.\nAfter sending the query, this note will no longer be seen unless the user has the privilege of ‘Edit Open Queries to resend’ in Role Management. An Edit checkbox will show on the date line, and checking it will show the query with the internal note.\nIn user reports, the following reports will display the “Query For” field in the same field as the “Query Template” column separated with a colon:\nOutstanding Queries Query Impact by Discharge Date Query Impact Report Query TAT by Author Report Query Template Volume Overview Form Designer will create a history for changes made to templates in Form Designer.

Once these are completed, the rest of the worksheet will populate.\nNo Charge If a patient fits the criteria for “no charges” (for example, a registration error), all other fields in the worksheet go away because there is nothing else to be done from an ER charging perspective. However, other selections from the list will populate the fields accordingly.\nCritical Care The next field to be considered is “Critical Care”.

As you complete the remaining sections, you may see the level advance.\nTrauma If the case was a trauma, make the appropriate selection from the dropdown menu (pre-hospital notification, post-hospital notification, consult).\nMedication Administration Qty Based on the selection, additional fields or boxes will populate. Complete the quantities, add modifiers, and any notes. Modifier fields are available in the appropriate sections of the worksheet. The “Notes” field is available for the coder to track things, like medications.

It the procedure is determined to have occurred elsewhere, leave the 0 in the field. (Note that when there is a CPT coded added that has no CDM charge, it won’t appear in this section; only those that have a CDM.)\nE/M Summary Once you complete the Additional Charges, you will see the Summary which details the E/M level and other charges with the corresponding CDM Code.\nWhen all charging is complete and the charges are ready to be submitted, check the “Send Charges Outbound” and select “SAVE” in the banner bar.\nThis action sends charges out and the account will automatically route to an outpatient/inpatient coder worklist so the rest of the coding that is not charge-related can be completed.\nIf the charges can’t be completed for some reason (missing trauma documentation), the box should NOT be checked, and instead, a pending reason should be assigned on the Code Summary.

If this is a search that you will want to use more than once, you can Save the search, making it available in the drop-down box\nThe results that yield may show you other codes, as the filter you place will bring up any chart with the codes suggested, however, the grid displays all codes on the account as well as the code in question.\nTo filter to only those codes within in the grid column, click on the 3 dashes in the column header to further filter the list.\nDocument Type Management This is used for many reasons, further explained here:\nFiling Documents Document Type Management can be used to file documents.\nOpen Document Type Management Sort on documents by clicking on the group name to display the documents currently not in a folder. Choose the documents that need to be filed. Change the friendly name by double-clicking on the name and replacing it with another name. It is important to remember to use a naming convention that new users will understand Engine Handling Engine Handling is set up after the documents have a friendly name. This set-up basically instructs the code suggesting engine what to do when it [engine] encounters the document. Does the engine suggest codes on the document or ignore it? What type of code does the engine suggest for that document?\nDepending on how your site is set up, there can be a drop-down menu to select the type of handling the document receives. On the other hand, there can be two different fields - one called inclusion and one called exclusion - that allows us to include or exclude certain code sets starting with a prefix. For example, on a document called Newborn History and Physical, the engine should exclude O codes so that if the documentation has mother documentation, the engine doesn’t get confused and try to suggest O codes on a newborn chart.\nFor further assistance setting up Engine Handling, contact the Tuning Team at results@dolbey.com Once engine handling is set up, it’s now time to place the document into a folder by double-clicking the empty space in the Group Name column and type in the name of the folder where the document should be filed. If you’re not familiar with the folder structure that is already set up, go to the top of the group name, hover over the column, and click on the three dashes to see all the group names that are available.\nCancels Pending Reason “Cancels Pending Reason” is a field In Document Types Management, which can be used to cancel an existing pending reason. By selecting this, the existing pending reason will remove the pending reason and re-trigger workflow. If you don’t want to delete this because the original pending reason is used for DNFC reporting and/or a user needs to know the original reason for pending, you don’t need to delete it. Instead, there is another option to Add a Pending reason.\nAdd a Pending Reason In Document Types Management, a field “Adds Pending Reason” now can contain the name of a pending reason to add when the document type is added to an account with matching pending reasons from the “Cancels Pending Reason” field.\nTwo important facts about the “Adds Pending Reason” field:\nThe presence of an “Adds Pending Reason” value overrides the functionality that cancels pending reasons from the “Cancels Pending Reason” field. In other words, when a pending reason exists on the account that matches the “Cancels Pending Reason” field, the pending reason is not deleted when there is an “Adds Pending Reason” value present. The functionality is designed to be one or the other – not both – but the account must have one of the “Cancels Pending Reasons” to add the pending reason. The “Adds Pending Reason” is intentionally free-form text. It can contain a value that is not listed in the Pending Reasons mapping so that users cannot select it. Whatever value is recorded in this field will be the pending reason name that the Script Engine will automatically add to the account. Enabling “Adds Pending Reason” If you wish to use this functionality, you must perform a one-time step to add the Adds Pending Reason column to the Document Types Management grid. This is done by clicking on the three dashes in the column header column, clicking on the column list tab, and checking Adds Pending Reason. In the grid, you double click in the field to edit the Adds Pending Reason field, but you must press Enter to “commit” that value before saving (just like all other text fields in this grid). The “Mass Edit” dialog in Document Types Management also supports the entry of the Adds Pending Reason field\nNew Document Grouping New Document Grouping allows you to automatically put documents into folders. For example, if the document name contains the word “consults” or “consultation”, you may want to file it within the Consults folder and set the engine handling set to Do not Code Procedures.\nBy default, users with the Administrator role or the Tuning role have access to the “New Document Grouping” page in the Tuning menu. In this page, users create a list of groups that should be created for new document types:\nGroup Name equals the name of an existing document group from Document Types Management. Note that when one is selected, its Group Order automatically populates. Add equals click to add a new document group that is not in Document Types Management. Users enter the document group name and its order number. Group Order = the sequence of the document grouping. Note this is copied from Document Types Management but it can be edited, which would only affect new document types. Includes, Excludes, and NLP Handling = same functionality as in Document Types Management Documents = click to add string matching for new document types from the interface. Note that there are four supported operators Sequencing buttons = new document types are processed through the groups in the order that is displayed How to Create a New Automated Grouping Click on + Add Group\nSelect the group name you are creating the automation for or click on the Add Button to create a new group that doesn’t already exist. Select how you want the engine to handle these types of documents - you can either have engine handling dropdown or use includes or excludes.\nEngine Handling Drop Down This drop down allows you to block certain code sets. But,if you need more targeted handling to include or exclude certain codes, then consider using the includes or excludes method shown below.\nIncludes and Excludes Using the includes or excludes allows you to override the settings and choose to either includeor exclude certain code prefixes. The below figure shows that this group will only include codes that begin with the prefix of A. To note you can not use both includes and excludes this is an either or.\nOnce you have set the folder and the engine handling, then select the documents you want to include in this group. Click on the edit button then select +Add. Then, choose your operator. HINT: Contains will likely be the best choice. For example, if you want to put all radiology documents into to a folder, you may consider that if it contains XR, NM, MRA, MRI, US, CT, then those should go into the radiology folder. Use a comma to separate multiple items. Click OK once complete. Once you have completed the new grouping, select Save All in the top right corner.\nCaution Code A caution code is a code that is suggested by the system but, cannot be assigned by a coder due to the document type. If a document is configured in Document Types management to be a caution code document it means the coder should not code from that but, be aware that the verbiage exists as it may result in a possible query. For example, if a nurse indicates the patient was being treated for respiratory failure but, the provider never mentioned it the caution code will help to ensure you aren’t missing anything.\nIn Document Types Management, change the “Caution Coding” field of the Document Type to “All Patient Types”. Save your change, then load the account and that document. A “caution coding” document is a document from which the user cannot assign codes, so the code suggestions within the document have a “caution” background instead of the usual lavender background. The Unassigned Code tree now displays the same caution background for those codes, and the right-click menu on those codes prevent assigning or changing the caution code.\nIn the Unassigned Codes pane, any code attached to that document will show in a yellow background, and will not have the option to assign on the right click menu.",

This allows the auditor to check off each code, drg and discharge disposition as it is audited.\nCACTWO-5243 (Enhancement) Add new option to the Edit codes feature in Assigned Codes pane\nIf a diagnosis code has a match in these three areas, Principal, Visit Reason, Admit, then a new ‘Edit Only’ option will appear in the right click menu, allowing only that particular instance to be changed.\nCACTWO-5245 (Enhancement) Allow pending reasons to be restricted by facility\nA new column has been added to Pending Reason in Mapping Configuration. This allows each reason to be restricted by the facility of the account. Multiple facilities can be added per reason.\nCACTWO-5246 (Enhancement) Allow pending reasons to be sorted in Mapping Configuration\nIn Mapping Configuration, Pending Reasons now has up/down arrows to allow for sorting.\nCACTWO-5247 (Important) Long error occurring when cancelling out of an account\nIn certain incidents, if a timeout occurred and the user cancelled out of an account before the timeout brought up the log in screen, a long red error was seen. This has been corrected so that if the user clicks cancel just as the timeout occurs, they will receive a much shorter time out message.\nCACTWO-5251 (Important) Document Type Management page not appearing correctly\nThe Document Type Management page was showing a number at the bottom that was not matching the amount of types displayed. This was caused when a Document Order field was populated. It has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5253 (Important) Validation rule using a ‘false’ statement is not working properly\nIf a criterion in a validation rule used a statement checking for a ‘false’ or ‘is not true’, the criterion was not being evaluated correctly. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5255 (Important) Workgroup is being cleared by Physician Coder submission\nWhen a Physician Coder submits an account, the assigned workgroup is being cleared. A new field has been created to stop the workgroup from changing or clearing.\nCACTWO-5265 (Important) Validation loop is not working if it’s the last criteria edited\nIf a Validation rule is created with a loop along with other criteria, if the loop is changed after the initial save, it is not being respected. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5269 (Important) Include autoclosed submissions in reports\nAutoclosed submits will now be included in these reports:\nCoder Activity Report Global Productivity User Detail Weekly Coder Activity Report CACTWO-5281 (Important) Prevent pending reason from getting deleted during upload of document\nPending Reasons can be removed when late arriving documents come in that have been set for a cancellation of the reason. This should not be happening for pending reasons added by physician coders. If a document type is set up with a cancel pending reason, it will no longer remove the reason when it comes into the account if the reason was added by a physician coder.\nCACTWO-5307 (Added) filter to calendar view to filter on physician coders\nOn the calendar view you can filter the data based upon a “Physician Coder” type please note that the “Single Path” activity is also included the physician coder data and the “Inpatient” or “Outpatient” views because single path coders do facility coding at the same time.",

CACTWO-5149 (Enhancement) Add permission role for Dolbey Community\nA new privilege called ‘Hide Access to Dolbey Community’ has been added to Role Management. If checked, that user type will no longer have access to Dolbey Community in the Help menu. Dolbey Community is a new web-based community for customer management teams launching on January 10, 2023. Dolbey Community is intended to bring Fusion CAC users together to collaborate and discuss topics that are important to you. You will have the opportunity to:\nAsk questions and get answers from your peers. Share ideas and best practices that you’ve learned along the way. Learn tips and tricks — or pass along some of your own. Access resources like release notes, training videos, and marketing materials. Submit feature requests that may be incorporated into future releases. If you would like a login for Dolbey Community, please reach out to the SMEteam@dolbey.com.\nCACTWO-5171 (Enhancement) Hide supporting evidence from documents\nSupporting evidence will now be hidden from documents by default. If the supporting evidence dialog is open, clicking on the icon next to the code will reveal the secondary codes. This will now be hidden to reduce the white noise of codes on a chart; however, the evidence is still available. Upon opening the supporting evidence dialog you will see the evidence markers.\nCACTWO-5224 (Enhancement) Allow TruCode™ edits while computing with any other encoder\nIf a site uses an encoder other than TruCode and wants to use the TruCode edits to supplement their existing encoder they can now do so to display MCE, OCE, and medical necessity edits (NCD/LCD).\nTruCode Edits License Required This feature requires a TruCode Edits License, please contact the SME Team for more information.\nCACTWO-5256 (Enhancement) Allow physicians to be attached to pending reasons from Account Search\nIf a pending reason is added to an account from account search and is configured to have a physician attached, the user can now add that physician in Account Search. Either single or multiple accounts can be highlighted, then in the right click menu, after Add Pending Reason is selected, if the pending reason selected from the dropdown is set to trigger for physician, the physician entry box will be displayed.\nTesting Steps Testing Steps: In Mappings Configuration, make sure you have at least one pending reason that requires a physician. In Account Search, select one or more accounts, then right-click and choose “Add Pending Reason”. Note that if you select a pending reason that requires a physician, an additional physician drop down appears. If the pending reason requires a physician, the physician cannot be left blank. After selecting a physician reason and physician, load the account and examine the Code Summary viewer. The physician should be present with the newly added pending reason.\nCACTWO-5257 (Enhancement) Allow mass removal of pending reasons in Account Search\nIf an account has multiple pending reasons, they will now all be removable using Account Search. In Account Search, the user will need to create a search using the Pending Reasons Drill Down Level. Highlighting one of the lines on the account (pending reasons each have their own lines) and right clicking to select Delete Pending Reasons will delete all reasons on the account without having to highlight each line.\nInfo Testing Steps: Perform this action on selected accounts, then examine these accounts in Account Detail. Any accounts with pending reasons should have their pending reasons removed.\nCACTWO-5264 (Enhancement) Add number ordering for criteria groups\nUsing Grid Column Configuration, first add the columns Custom Criteria Sequence and Criteria Sequence. With these added to the Account List, users will be able to see the sequence of the criteria group. The sequence will also be viewable in Workflow Management, in front of each criterion. Re- arranging the criteria list will update the sequence number as needed.\nTesting Steps Testing Steps: In Grid Columns Management, add the column “Criteria Sequence” for default workgroups and the column “Custom Criteria Sequence” for custom workgroups. For both columns, make sure the “Account List” checkboxes are checked. (Note that these columns are not added automatically; not all sites will use this feature.)\nThe criteria group sequence number is now displayed in Workflow Management. When an account is assigned to a workgroup and criteria group, the criteria group sequence is now recorded with the workgroup assignment. The column “Criteria Sequence” will display the sequence number for default workflow and the column “Custom Criteria Sequence” will display the sequence number for custom workflow. Like with “Criteria Group”, these columns are swapped when examining a specific workgroup in the Account List page, depending on whether the workgroup is a default workgroup or a custom workgroup. The “Matched Criteria Groups” viewer will also display the sequence number for matched criteria.\nRe-run Workflow to Update Existing Accounts This feature is commonly used with CDI and this feature is not retroactive for existing accounts. Workflow must be rerun on existing accounts and the account’s workgroup, or criteria group must change to see the sequence number.\nCACTWO-5283 (Enhancement) Allow chronological sort for documents\nThe user can now right click within the document tree and a new menu option ‘Show Chronologically’ will be there. When clicked, it will sort all the documents in chronological order. The order will be saved per user and can easily be changed back by right clicking for the menu, from where they can choose ‘Show Document Groups’.\nCACTWO-5294 (Enhancement) New capture rate report for CC/MCC\nA new user report has been created called CC/MCC Capture rate. It will show the final result of CC/MC capture rates\nCACTWO-5296 (Enhancement) Show provider name on document\nIf a provider name is sent in the meta data of a document, it will now show in the Document tree, next to its document. The name is shown after a comma, and will be order by last name, first name.\nCACTWO-5298 (Enhancement) Add MDC fields columns\nGrid Column Configuration will now allow the addition of 4 columns: Final MDC, Final MDC Description, Working MDC, and Working MDC Description.\nCACTWO-5308 (Enhancement) Add dropdown to hide coding in Document Management\nA new column, Hide Coding, has been added to Document Types Management, allowing the user to choose to show suggested codes based on whether the account is inpatient or outpatient.\nThis will allow sites to hide codes, for example, on radiology reports or supporting documentation “non” physician documents for inpatient charts only.\nCACTWO-5311 (Enhancement) Add new sort fields to workgroups\nIn Workflow Management, the fields below have been added to the Sort/Field Direction boxes for workgroups. When no other sort order has been set in Account list, this is the sort order that will be followed.\nActive Matches Criteria Groups Admit Date w/ Time Age in Years Billing Countdown Discharge Date w/ Time Late Document Count Random Inclusion Factor Total Documents CACTWO-5312 (Enhancement) Add Financial Class filter to CDI Metric Scorecard\nThe CDI Metric Scorecard report is based on inpatient activity. A filter for Financial Class has been added. Other updates to the report include number of queries with a disagreement; percentage of queries with a disagreement; and DRG pre-bill and post bill match rates.\nCACTWO-5313 (Enhancement) Add ability to use document status for validation rules\nIf a document has been added as a for each loop in the Validation Management editor. Users can now create a validation rule that will look at each document status and report each instance of a matched validation rule on the Code Summary viewer.\nUse Case Example Use Case: Prevent coders from submitting the account when a document is in something other than signed status and notify them using validation rules to provide a hard or soft stop to add a pending reason. Common document status includes but are not limited to:\nD = draft P = preliminary F = final S = signed A = addendum Document Status Flag Required This feature requires a document interface that provides a document status flag. Check your interface before adopting this feature.\nCACTWO-5314 (Enhancement) Change expands all options to increase performance\nTo help with performance, some menus have been changed. The right click menu on the Document tree now has an Expand option that allows for collapse or expand of documents. There is no longer a code expansion, that is done by the plus sign only. On the Unassigned/All Codes tree, in the right click menu, the Expand option will allow users to expand Codes. This will show the codes, or collapse all to hide the codes and only show the headings.\nCACTWO-5316 (Important) Add facility filters to Administrative dashboards\nThree dashboards will now have the ability to filter by facility: Audit Management, CDI Management and Administrative. The filters will apply to most dashboards, except for the Autoclose, Discharged Not Final Coded, and any panel displaying user counts. The top of the dashboard contains the filter, and once the user clicks to filter and selects the facilities desired, clicking the refresh button will refresh all the panels to only show the results for that facility or facilities.\nCACTWO-5317 (Important) User clicking ‘refresh’ during account load causes accounts to be removed\nWhen an account list is in the process of being retrieved and a user clicks the refresh button, the beginning of the list is removed. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5318 (Important) Validation Editor not evaluating criteria of Charge Codes exist correctly\nIf multiple charges exist on an account and one of them does not have a CPT code, a validation for Charges Exist does not work properly. This has been corrected.\nTesting Steps Testing Steps: You need an account with charges where at least one charge does not have a CPT Code. In Validation Editor, add a rule “Charge Codes –\u003e Exists”. On that account, if at least one charge has a CPT Code, the rule should trigger even if another charge doesn’t have a CPT Code.\nCACTWO-5321 (Important) SOI/ROM values on banner bar do not match Audit Worksheet\nIf an Audit was opened on an account with SOI/ROM values, those values on the banner bar were not matching what was showing on the Audit worksheet. The Audit Viewer displays the ROM where the SOI should be displayed. The data on the account and the audit is correct; it’s just the display that is incorrect. This has been corrected.\nRequires Audit Management This feature requires Audit Management which is an additional module; please contact SME Team if you are interested in learning more. This also requires an APR- DRG license.\nCACTWO-5322 (Enhancement) Provider not showing in drop-down when last name entered contains a space\nIf a Physician has a last name containing a space, such as Van Hutton or De Graff, the physician is not found when searching on the Physicians \u0026 Queries page or on a procedure to add the provider by the first part of the last name. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5326 (Enhancement) Show middle name in 3M™ Coding and Reimbursement System (CRS)\nencoder The 3M CRS encoder was only showing the patient’s last name. This has been changed to show the patient’s first, middle and last name in the encoder.\n3M CRS Users This feature is for 3M CRS users only\nCACTWO-5327 (Important) Changing query from Cancelled to Wrong Provider doubles query\nWhen using the “Change Physician” option on an open query a query is created as expected, but when reopening the query and changing the cancelled reason to “Wrong Provider” a second query was resent. To prevent this, there is now a dropdown on the Change Physician button that will drop down the cancel reasons. Clicking Send New Query will send the query to the new physician and close the query to the incorrect one. If a user then reopens that cancelled query and changes the cancel reason at the bottom, an additional query will not be sent.\nCACTWO-5328 (Enhancement) Change HCC Viewer to show friendly value\nThe HCC Viewer has been updated to show the mapped friendly value for the Category.\nCACTWO-5331 (Important) CDI Activity report is displaying 00:00:00 for some charts\nOn the CDI Activity report, any chart with a facility on it caused the records ‘Time Spent’ to zero out. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5332 (Enhancement) New ‘Today’s Date’ fields created\nIn Grid Column Configuration, two new options have been added: Today’s Date and Today’s Date /w Time. These can be added to show the current date and time on any screen chosen as a column, including Scheduled Reports.\nCACTWO-5334 (Important) CDI Query reports percentages are not being computed correctly\nThe CDI Query Score Card and CDI Query Score Card by Admission Month reports were not calculating the DRG Pre-Bill and Post-Bill percentages correctly. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5336 (Enhancement) Allow Modifier entry to code by using hyphen\nIn version 1, the software allowed you to enter a CPT Code followed by a dash and a modifier. The version 2 software now has this feature. When adding, editing, or mass editing a CPT code, the modifier can be added by adding a hyphen after the code, along with the modifier.\nCACTWO-5338 (Important) Prevent Out of Memory exceptions in Account list\nIf there are more than 5000 accounts in a workgroup when loading the account list, the user will now see an error message:\nCACTWO-5340 (Enhancement) Allow for default POA other than Y\nCAC now allows the installation to configure the default POA other than Y Contact Support to implement this option.\nCACTWO-5341 (Enhancement) Add columns and calculations for Audit Abstract Report\nThe Audit Abstract Report will display the calculation of modifier changes. The number of original modifiers, plus the number of new modifiers are added to the Pre Audit score. Several column names have been updated accordingly.\nCACTWO-5343 (Important) Using computed field in Account Search doesn’t return all results\nIf there were more than 1000 accounts that matched an Account Search that used a computed field, such as Age in Years, then all results were not being shown. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5344 (Enhancement) Screen changes for the New Document Grouping page\nSeveral updates to the New Document Grouping page have been made. The ‘delete all’ button has been removed, and the ‘save all’ button has been changed to ‘save all groups’ for clarity. A confirmation pop up will now occur when deleting a document group.\nCACTWO-5348 (Enhancement) Prevent “Account Changed” dialog when only images are redownloaded\nWhen a change is made upstream to an image on an account while that account is opened, the Account Changed box pops. This has been changed so that only documents will cause the change box to open.\nCACTWO-5350 (Enhancement) Banner Bar is not showing Discharge Disposition title\nThe Discharge Disposition in the banner bar has been changed to now show the title from the Discharge Disposition mapping, instead of being hard coded.\nCACTWO-5357 (Enhancement) Add productivity count to top of screen so the coder does not have to return to\ndashboard to know productivity When a user clicks on their user ID in the right corner of the screen, a new chart will appear showing the updated work count for the day. If the user is both CDI and Coder, the chart that appears will be based on the current profile This allows the user to see how charts were worked today without needing to return to the dashboard. In this instance, the user is a coder:\nCACTWO-5360 (Enhancement) Allow 3M CRS facility to be populated in CAC2\nDolbey now supports the field available in 3M CRS which is an account-level “EncoderFacility’ field.\n3M CRS Users Only This feature is for 3M CRS users only.\nCACTWO-5362 (Enhancement) Add PSI data to the After Audit section of Audit worksheet\nIf an account has a PSI assignment, it shows on the Coder Outcome (Pre-Audit) side of the Audit Worksheet. The PSI assignment will now also show on the Auditor Outcome (Post-Audit) side after the Update Codes button is clicked\nCACTWO-5366 (Important) CDI Query Score Card reports should not count all accounts\nThe CDI Query Score Card and CDI Query Score Card by Admission Month should only count accounts with both Working and Final DRGs on the first Submit in the Pre-Bill Mismatch statistics. It was counting all first submit accounts. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5367 CACTWO-5366 (Important) CDI Query Score Card reports should not count all accounts\nThe CDI Query Score Card and CDI Query Score Card by Admission Month should only count accounts with both Working and Final DRGs on the first Submit in the Post-Bill Mismatch statistics. It was counting all first submit accounts. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5370 (Important) Visit Reasons being unassigned when assigning Admit or Principal Diagnosis\nOn an outpatient account, if a Diagnosis code was set as a Visit Reason, then subsequently right clicked on and added as Admit or Principal, the Visit Reason was being deleted. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5371 (Enhancement) Allow Single Path user to switch between facility and professional charge\nIf facility charges and professional charges are received separately on an account, a single path user will be able to toggle between facility and professional charges. The toggle will appear in the upper left corner of the charges viewer.\nCACTWO-5375 (Enhancement) Add ROM/SOI indicators on more viewers\nThe Working CDI History viewer and the Final Code Summary viewer will now show columns for ROM/SOI and HAC/HCC per each code. The designation HAC will be shown in the CC/MCC column, when applicable.\nCACTWO-5382 (Important) 3M CRS responses are doubling\n3M CRS responses are doubling if the user is timed out of the app and then logs back in and reopens the account. This has been corrected. For 3M CRS users only\nCACTWO-5384 (Important) Audit Worksheet checkboxes are being unchecked\nIf the Audit Management viewer is popped out to another tab and a checkbox in the Coder Outcome (Pre-Audit) is checked, adding a code on the main browser was clearing the checked box.

Accounts must be discharged and submitted to appear in this report. This report will show the breakdown per coder MS-DRG to show the total visits per DRG.\nCACTWO-5408 (Important) Cannot reassign codes in Edit All Codes page\nWith the Edit All Codes page open, changing a Secondary diagnosis to Principal changes the codes. But, if the user then tried to change the former Principal back to Principal, that option was not in the codes select dropdown. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5413 (Important) Allow 3M CRS to stay open past timeout\nFor sites with the 3M CRS encoder, the timeout will now be advanced by 4 hours when using 3M CRS as the encoder. If 3M is open, the timeout will be held for 4 hours before activating. For 3M CRS users only\nCACTWO-5414 (Enhancement) Disallow coders from changing charge physician\nCoders can now be prevented from changing the physician on a charge. Please contact Support to enable this feature\nCACTWO-5416 (Enhancement) Allow Scheduled Reports to generate blank report for emails\nIn a previous release there was a feature that if an account search yielded no results, it would prevent a report from being generated. This feature is turned off by default. The system will not generate an email with blank results until it is enabled. Please contact Support to enable this feature\nCACTWO-5418 (Enhancement) Show full assigned username in Code Summary\nThe default Code Summary will now show the full username with the ID in parenthesis if an account is assigned to a user rather than a workgroup.\nCACTWO-5419 CACTWO-5421 (Important) Edit Pending Reason link missing in Workflow Management\nWhen copying criteria from workflow management that has a Pending Reason, the copy is not showing the Edit Pending Reason link at the end of the criteria line. This has been corrected. If the workgroup is copied and another criterion is added to the Pending Reason criteria group, it was copying down that reason instead of showing a blank for whatever criteria was chosen. This is now corrected.\nCACTWO-5422 (Important) Account Search not paging properly\nIf a filter in Account Search uses a computed field (such as Age), then the numbering of accounts per page did not show correctly. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-5424 (Important) Save Last Saver if Auditor saves/submits an account\nCurrently, an Auditor will only show as last saver if there has been a saver/submitter before. It did not show as a first saver. This has been corrected so that no matter what, the auditor’s name will show if last saved.\nCACTWO-5427 (Important) Alert user to not close browser when logging out to save an account\nIf the user is in an account, clicks on the Log Out menu option, and chooses “Save the account,” the user needs to be notified not to close the browser until the save is completed. There is no visual indicator to indicate that a save is in progress if the save takes a few seconds. Closing the browser early could prevent the account from saving completely.\nCACTWO-5437 (Important) Engine Results by CDI is not filtering correctly\nWhen adding Users to the Users field in the Engine Outcome per CDI report, the results were not the same as if you ran the report without filtering to specific user. This has been corrected so that the user filter looks at the same columns a non-filtered report does.",

New Module (Enhancement) Add CDI Alerts Module\nThe software has a feature called CDI Alerts which are automated messages generated by the software that can be used to prioritize your CDI workflow. CDI Alerts are used to detect potential inaccuracies, inconsistencies and or discrepancies in clinical documentation. These Alerts help CDI teams to prioritize the charts based on potential query opportunities available.\nThe software provides real-time Alerts when potential query opportunities are identified. Which will then allow CDI staff to prioritize charts based upon those potential opportunities.\nCDI Alerts can also be used by coding and auditing charts where CDI did not review the chart.\nContact SME for more information If you are upgrading, please contact Dolbey’s SME Team for more information on purchasing and enabling this feature.\nCACTWO-5378 (Enhancement) Allow multiple Denials to be added to a single account\nThe Denial Management viewer will now allow multiple sheets to be created.

This field will have a dropdown with all available pending reasons. If a rule is triggered on an account and it has a pending reason attached, then the pending reason will be added and the user will be able to see the number of the rule. Pending reasons that have a physician or date requirement will NOT be available in this list. The only way to remove a pending reason that was added by a rule is to have that rule cleared.\nCACTWO-5964 (Enhancement) Allow Document Search box to be resized\nIn an account, when the Document Search is opened, the box can now be resized by grabbing and pulling the lower right corner.\nCACTWO-5972 (Enhancement) Add zoom in and out ability to text based documents\nThe ability to zoom in and out has been added as a right click option in documents, both on the main page and a pop out. This new zoom feature will work for Chrome and Edge users. When a user selects a zoom level, that level will be retained for all documents and the last zoom used before log out is the zoom level the user will get when they sign back in.\nCACTWO-6041 (Enhancement) Add Provider Name and Date to the document viewer header\nIf there is a physician name and date of service that is sent on the interface for a document, the physician name and date will now show in the document viewer header, on the popout, and in the Ctrl+ click of the header.\nCACTWO-6098 (Enhancement) Highlight Navigation pane if Query draft exists\nThe Physicians \u0026 Queries viewer on the Navigation Pane will now show with an amber highlight if there is a Query Draft. When the draft is either updated and sent or deleted, the amber color will go away.\nCACTWO-6107 (Enhancement) On HCC codes, display HCC version to support V24 and v28\nA code that is followed by an HCC indicator in account detail will now display the version of HCC for calendar year 2023 (retroactively) and 2024 when the user hovers over the H in the Assigned Codes panel. On the Final Code Summary and the Working CDI History viewer, the code’s HCC designation will show the HCC number and its version.\nCACTWO-6108 (Enhancement) Allow history on changes in Form Designer\nForm Designer will now create a history for changes made in Form Designer. Once a change is made on a form and saved, a Show History button will show in the top right of the worksheet.

These fields can also be added to Grid Maintenance.\nCACTWO-6117 (Enhancement) Allow all stratums for PSI 04 quality indicators to show in Code Summary\nIn the Algorithm for Quality Indicators section of the Code Summary viewer, only the first PSI 04 indicator is displaying. This has been updated to show all 5 of the indicators.\nCACTWO-6118 (Important) CDI Activity Report grand total line is incorrect if users are filtered\nIf the CDI Activity Report is being filtered to just one user, the Grand Total line is showing the total for all users instead of just the one filtered. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-6120 (Important) OR groups are not showing in new Workflow Management page\nIf an OR group is added to workgroup level criteria, it is not appearing within each criteria group. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-6122 (Important) Audit Management error rate not being reported correctly in reports\nThe following reports were not calculating the Audit Management error rate correctly. They have been corrected.\nAudit Executive Summary Inpatient Auditor Productivity Inpatient Coder Scorecard Outpatient Audit Scorecard Outpatient Auditor Productivity Outpatient Coder Scorecard CACTWO-6125 (Important) CDI Activity Report is not reporting Reconciliation correctly\nThe CDI Activity Report was reporting a DRG Reconciliation if an account set for DRG Reconciliation was opened, but then cancelled out. This has been corrected so that accts cancelled will no longer be included.\nCACTWO-6126 (Enhancement) Allow Users to be excluded from the Inactivity prompt\nNew funcitonality has been added so that Role Management now contains an option to exclude a role type from being triggered.\nCACTWO-6135 (Enhancement) Allow Flowsheet to save the collapse function\nIf a user collapses or uncollapses a major category on the Flowsheet viewer, that configuration will remain for all accounts that have the Flowsheet viewer. Note that if a user collapses/uncollapses a major category in the pop out, it will not be seen on the main page until the user moves to a different viewer and back.\nCACTWO-6136 (Important) Auditor Physician Query Draft line is not showing on Dashboard\nIf an auditor, CDI specialist, or coder has at least one query draft but no sent queries, the total drafts count will now appear for the role with the open queries, unanswered, and answer counts displaying as zero on the dashboard.\nCACTWO-6144 (Enhancement) Show friendly values in Workflow dropdowns\nCurrently the new Workflow Management page is not showing the friendly value for criteria of a property with a mapping. This has been changed to show the friendly value, just like the classic Workflow Management page.\nCACTWO-6146 (Important) 3M is opening another instance when opening a dashboard drilldown\nIf a user opens a dashboard drilldown, another window with 3M is opened. This has been corrected so that there is only ever one 3M open.\n3M Web Component Users Only This fix is only applicable for 3M Web Component users.\nCACTWO-6147 (Enhancement) Hide Visit reason fields if there are none on the account\nThe Audit Management Worksheet viewer will no longer show all of the Visit Reason fields if there are no visit reasons on the account left by the coder or the auditor. If a visit reason is added by the auditor during the audit process, the Visit Reason fields will open up when the auditor clicks the Update Codes button.\nCACTWO-6150 (Important) Reports are not properly counting intial reviews of accounts\nIf a CDI Specialist creates a Baseline DRG (the first Working DRG), then edits the account further causing the Working DRG to be cleared, and then saves the account without computing a new Working DRG, the creation of the Baseline DRG now counts as an initial review.\nCACTWO-6181 (Important) New Workflow Management page is holding Note text when it should clear\nAdding text into the Note field in a workgroup was resulting in that same text appearing in every subsequent workflow This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-6188 (Important) Adding workflow is changing the workflow order in User Maintenance\nIf new workflow is added to the new Workflow Management page, the users attached to that workflow are having their order in the User Management profile change. This has been corrected so that any newly added workflow will go to the end of the list in the new Workflow Management page and the User Management profile.\nCACTWO-6195 (Important) Reporting is not calculating manually added codes properly\nTwo user reports (Coder Suggestion Use by Coder and Engine Results by Documents) were not calculating codes added manually. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-6201 (Enhancement) Allow Query to be created and closed in one step\nFor customers who do not have a physician query interface and do not createa physician query until a response is received, a query can now be created and not sent. When enabled, a physician query will show a “Continue” button in place of “Send”. Clicking the ‘Continue’ button will refresh the query to open the physician response fields so that the query can then be closed. This is common for Epic EMR customers.\nAdditional Configuration Required Please contact Support to enable this feature.\nCACTWO-6202 (Important) Improve performance of encoder calculations with several codes\nWhen a user performs an encoder computation, the red bar showing that an encoder is open was taking a few seconds to disappear over the Compute/Save/Submit buttons. This has been corrected so that it disappers sooner.\nCACTWO-6204 (Enhancement) Update Audit reports to show blank for accuracy\nFor the Inpatient Coder Scorecard and the Outpatient Coder Scorecard if there are no CPT or PCS codes, the CPT Codes and PCS Codes accuracy columns will now display as blank, rather than 100%.\nCACTWO-6205 (Enhancement) Make Accuracy rates stand out in the Audit Worksheet\nTo make the accuracy rate lines stand out in the Audit Worksheet, the backgrounds have been changed to show as light blue.\nCACTWO-6217 (Important) Field in worksheet showing as ‘Select an item’ when printed\nOn worksheets, dropdowns prompting users to select an item were not displaying the selection when that worksheet was printed. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-6224 (Enhancement) Allow DRG Reconcilation to compare DRG weight\nA new setting has been created that, when set to true, will compare DRG weights as well as the DRG during reconciliation. By default, the comparing of DRG Weights will be disabled.\nAdditional Configuration Required Please contact Support to implement this change.\nCACTWO-6225 (Important) Account Search not using ‘only contains’ properly with “Assigned Diagnosis with POA N” field\nAccount Search will now correctly use the Only Contains criterion.\nCACTWO-6239 (Important) Code Suggestion by Coder report is not calculating correctly\nWhen a code is being added via 3M to an account that is then being submitted, that code is not showing up in the Direct column of the From Other Sources section of the Code Suggestion Use by Coder report.

The severities used are: Critical - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at all sites running previous versions. Conditionally Critical - Recommended that this application be upgraded as soon as possible at all sites running previous versions matching the stated conditions. Important - Recommended upgrading the application if the customer is experiencing the issue denoted or currently applying a work-around for a specific non-functional feature. Enhancement - Recommended upgrading only if the specific functionality is desired. CACTWO-5598 (Enhancement) Include new accounts when autoloading\nA new database setting has been created to allow a change to how auto- loading works.\nWhen set to true, if an account is added to a workgroup currently being worked by a user with auto-load enabled and that new account has a discharge date before the date of the account being worked, the next account to autoload will be that new account, rather than the next account in the workgroup list.\nAdditional Configuration Required Please contact CAC Support to enable this feature.\nCACTWO-5823 (Enhancement) Create symbols to identify Auditor code changes on Audit Worksheet\nThe Audit Worksheet will display new symbols next to codes that were changed between the Coder and Auditor.\nA green ‘plus’ sign indicates the code was added. A red ‘minus’ sign indicates the code was deleted. A orange up or down ‘arrow’ sign indicates the code location has been changed (ex. a primary and secondary are swapped.) CACTWO-5865 (Enhancement) Allow Audit Subtypes to be context sensitive based upon what audit type was selected\nA new column has been added to Mapping Configuration for the Auidt Type mapping. This new Audit Subtype column will allow Administration to limit the subtypes available for each Audit Type.\nWhen an auditor then selects that Audit type in the Audit Worksheet, instead of getting the full list of subtypes, the user will only see the subtypes allowed.\nIn this example, the Audit Type CC/MCC only has a subtype of Coder available, so that is all that will show in the dropdown selection.\nCACTWO-6030 (Enhancement) Add a section for Rebills to the Audit Worksheet\nThe end of the Audit Worksheet has been changed to allow for an Auditor to ask if the audit requires a rebill.\nWhen answered ‘Yes,’ the Auditor can additional record a date for a rebill.\nCACTWO-6033 (Enhancement) Allow auditor to submit and route to coder post audit\nAn Auditor can now submit an account and either 1) submit and close the audit, or 2) complete an audit on a chart, submit it as the auditor and then route it back to the coder without the need to go back into the chart and route it to the coder. This new box will appear when submitting an audit if the audit isn’t closed yet and when doing so, will receive this new query box:\nCACTWO-6060 (Enhancement) Allow Audit worksheet to be printed\nA new print button at the top right of an audit worksheet will allow the worksheet to be printed.\nAdditional Configuration Required Please contact CAC Support to enable printing\nCACTWO-6074 (Enhancement) Change the way Forced Autoload works\nSeveral changes have been made to how Forced Autoload lists to-do accounts for the user.\nWhen a Forced Autoload user logs off (and does or does not close the browser) and logs back in during the same calendar the application will remember where the user left off and start the autoload feed there. Additional Configuration May Be Required If you would like this changed back to the original ‘start from beginning upon launch of ‘Go To Next Autoload’; please contact Support.\nIf a user has a chart assigned directly to them while they are working on an assigned list, that chart will be next in the autoload process. When completed, the user will be taken back to where they left off within the list they were working. If a support personnel re-assigns a chart to a workgroup that is currently being worked by a forced autoload user and the chart’s discharge date is older than the one the forced user is currently in, when the user cancels/saves the account, the earlier chart wll be next in the list. After the chart is completed, the list will resume where the user left of CACTWO-6116 (Enhancement) Add Privilege in Role Management to allow a user to add an account note or bookmark and worksheet\nA new privilege, Edit Only Account Notes, Bookmarks, and Worksheets has been created in Role Management to disallow any code work. When this privilege, is checked, the role will be able to only add a Note or Bookmark to a document, add and edit new worksheets, and add a comment on an unassigned code. No coding work can be done.\nCACTWO-6168 (Enhancement) Allow lists to be attached to keys in Mapping Configuration\nA new Mapping Configuration has been created called CriteriaFindAndReplace. Once that mapping is created, keys attached to lists of items can be added. In Account Search,Workflow, and Scheduled Account Searche, the key can be used after the operator of ‘In List’ or ‘Includes Any Of’ as applicable when creating criteria. The key will allow all items attached to it to be considered in the equation.\nFor example, if a user wants to create a key for Elixhauser to be used for the diagnosis codes within a group, they would add a key of Elixhuaser categories, with the description being the comma separated list of each of the different categories for example:\nThen, in Account Search, Scheduled Account Search, or Workflow, the user would use a criteria as shown below. CAC2 will look at ‘ELIX_HF` and apply the criteria to all of the numbers listed in the Mapping description in the equation.\nIf an account had a diagnosis code of I50.20, this criteria would pick it up, since that code is associated with the key of ELIX_HF.\nCase Sensitive This field is case sensitive. Criteria must match the case of the key in Mappings.\nElixhauser Mappings For Elixhauser users, having the Elixhauser coding updated will automatically create keys and descriptions for all Diagnosis Codes associated with Elixhauser in this new mapping.\nCACTWO-6170 (Enhancement) Allow filtering of multiple documents in the Documents Viewer\nOn an account, the user can now select multiple documents from the Documents pane by using Shift+Left Click or Ctrl+ LeftClick, then right-clicking to choose ‘Filter Selected’.\nThis will hide all unselected documents. A filter button will show in the panel title showing the total number of documents along with what have been filtered. In the below example, the account had 14 documents and was filtered so that only 3 showed. When the filter button is clicked, hidden documents will reappear. The filter can also be canceled by clicking on any code in the Unassigned/All Code trees.\nCACTWO-6203 (Enhancement) Create error message when computing 3M with dates prior to Oct 1 2015\nCurrently, TruCode™ displays a red error message if a user tries to compute a DRG when an account has an Admit date, Discharge date, or Procedure Date before October 1, 2015. This error has been extended to include computations using 3M™.\n3M™ Users Only This feature applies to 3M Users Only\nCACTWO-6219 (Enhancement) Allow banner bar to be customizeable for printing\nThe banner bar that is printed on the top of each of the document and/or forms can now be customized.. Your site must allow for printing.\nAdditional Configuration May Be Required Contact CAC Support for customized banner-print.html\nCACTWO-6231 (Enhancement) Change size of checkbox in Form Designer\nWhen Checkbox is chosen as a field in a form in the Form Designer page, the checkbox will now appear much larger in the document or query.\nCACTWO-6248 (Enhancement) Do not show Trauma section if not configured in the E\u0026M Config within the E\u0026M viewer\nIf the “Trauma” section of E\u0026M Configuration is configured with 0 or 1 options, then the Trauma section will not appear in the E\u0026M Viewer for an account where “IsEmergencyRoomVisit” is set to true.\nCACTWO-6251 (Enhancement) Add new CDI fields to be used for Workgroup Management sorting\nFirst and Last CDI Saver fields have been addedto the sort field options in workflow management per workgroup. These will now show in the dropdown of the Sort Field, under Properties of a Workgroup. This will allow for that column to be sorted ascending or descending.\nCACTWO-6292 (Enhancement) Create new columns for query draft totals\nThree new fields have been created to show totals for queries in draft status. Users can add the fields via Grid Column Configuration as needed.\nPhysician Query Drafts CDI Physician Query Drafts Coder Physician Query Drafts CACTWO-6325 (Enhancement) Allow Physician Query to be quick closed with manual entry\nA new button has been added to the Physician Query viewer. After adding a manual query response, a user can click Quick Complete, to complete without having to send the query to the Physician.\nCACTWO-6333 (Enhancement) Allow mass editing of modifiers\nWhen multiple CPT codes are selected in the mass edit window and all the CPT codes have a common modifier, it will now display in the modifier box so that it can be removed, if necessary, from all CPT codes.\nCACTWO-6340 (Enhancement) Allow Custom Workgroup to be retained upon reassignment\nThe Mapping Configuration ‘Workgroup Types’ now has a column called Used By. This column lists user types, which, when added to a workgroup type in a custom workgroup, will cause the workgroup to be retained IF the user that is assigning an account has a profile that matches what is contained in the Use By column.\nAs an example, for Workgroup ‘Cardiology Physician’, the Workgroup Type is set as Physician Coding. In Mapping, Workgroup Type, I have set the Used By column to Retain Always. If a user is a Hospital Coder and assigns an account to another user and that chart was also assigned to the Cardiology Physician Workgroup, it will be retained.\nIf the user is a Physicain Coder and assigns that account to another user, then the custom workgroup Cardiology Physician will be removed along with any other workgroup on that account.\nTo configure, examine the mapping for WorkGroupType in Mappings Configuration. A new column, “Used By,” is present.\nRetain Always An option of Retain Always can be set in the Use By column of the WorkgroupType in Mappings, which will cause the Custom Workgroup using that type to always be retained when an account is reassigned.\nCACTWO-6343 (Enhancement) Allow 3M™ to save position on second monitor\nThe software will now remember where you last placed the 3M Coding and Reimbursement window(s) on your screen. When you reopen these windows, they will appear in the same position as before.\nThis new feature works by using the Windows Management API. The first time you log in after the update, you’ll see a message asking you to give permission for this API to run. It’s important that all users agree to this, no matter how many monitors you have or whether you use this feature right now. Saying yes will help us use this technology for more improvements in the future.\nCACTWO-6350 (Enhancement) Add Auditor Activity to several coder reports\nThe following user reports will now automatically contain auditor activity in addition to the coder activity:\nCoder Activity Global Productivity User Detail Weekly Coder Activity CACTWO-6351 (Important) Prevent the Search Document window from shrinking\nWhen a Document Search window is used continually, each time the window is getting smaller. This has been corrected.\nCACTWO-6378 (Important) Prevent multiple pop up boxes from resizing themselves\nIf more than one pop box is open at once, like a Document Search box and a Physician Query box, when one is resized, the other is automatically resizing.\nThis has been corrected so that the second box is not resized.\nCACTWO-6392 (Enhancement) Allow Physician Query to show differences\nA new button will now show under a physician (or manual) recorded answer of a Physician Query, allowing the user to see anything that was added to the query by the physician that received it.\nClicking the Show Diff button will show any additions or subtractions made to the query in the response in blue or red highlights.\nIn this example, the physician has marked a line and added text after it, and the Show Diff button now shows as Hide Diff since it was deployed to view the response:\nCACTWO-6399 (Enhancement) Add Total Charges to Validation Manager\nThe field Total Charges has been added to Validation Management as an account field.\nCACTWO-6410 (Enhancement) Add Calculated Date/Time as a field\nA new field, Calculated Date/Time, has been added. This field shows the last time the encoder was run. If it’s blank, the encoder needs to be run. This can help the user find accounts that should have an APC, DRG, or if a coder clicked on the encode to run edits.\nCACTWO-6422 (Important) Send proper cancel message rather than blank HL7 to Epic FEWS\nFor Epic customers who switched from COM integration to FEWS, an issue that was causing errors in Epic has been corrected. Previously in the COM integration, when someone clicked “cancel” in Fusion CAC, an empty message was sent to Epic to close the communication. With FEWS these same blank messages cause errors. Now, canceling a chart in the latest version won’t lead to these errors in Epic for those using FEWS integration.\nCACTWO-6458 (Important) Update to Elixahuser codes\nThere has been an update to use Elixhauser v2024 for Elixhauser coding.",

This has been added to the description.\nCACTWO-6638 (Important) Abstraction pre-audit calculation is incorrect\nIn the Audit Management viewer, the “Abstraction Pre-Audit” calculation is incorrect, although user reports correctly displayed the accurate calculation in releases v2.53 and v2.54. In these releases, the calculation omitted the procedure codes for which users had recorded a procedure date or physician. This issue affected only the display in the audit viewer, not the Audit user reports.\nCACTWO-6463 (Enhancement) New way of viewing linked discrete values from CDI Alerts\nIf a discrete value’s name appears in more than one category within the discrete data viewer within a major category when it is linked from the CDI Alerts viewer, the entire major category will be highlighted in the Flowsheet viewer. Otherwise, the original functionality of just highlighting its single category applies.\nCACTWO-6532 (Enhancement) Collapse all CDI Alerts when opening CDI Alerts Viewer\nPreviously, all CDI Alerts were expanded making it hard to view all alerts. This requests was to initially be collapsed when the account is loaded.\nCACTWO-6578 (Enhancement) Add Other choice with drop down on the Close CDI Alert Dialog Box\nAdd new option of Other with the ability to add drop down box on the Close CDI Alert Dialog Box. This allows the user to Close an Alert because it did not require a query to be sent and not because the Alert was wrong. They state occasionally even though an Alert triggered appropriately; after reviewing a query is not needed, they do not want to count it negatively as the alert did what it was supposed to.\nIt will only appear if a mapping with the ID “DrillDownMatchedCriteriaGroups_OtherOutcome” is created in Mappings Configuration with additional alternate outcomes. The alternate outcomes will be displayed in the Closed CDI Alert.\nCACTWO-6580 (Enhancement) Add line spacing to evidence\nPreviously, the spacing was condensed; this adjustment provides more vertical spacing, making the alert evidence easier to read.",
