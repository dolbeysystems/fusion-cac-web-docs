    <title>Privacy of the Audit Viewer :: Fusion CAC Documentation</title>
    <link>https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/auditor-user-guide/privacy-of-the-audit-viewer/</link>
    <description>The auditor will need to add the coder of record so that the coder of record, any auditor, or other user role that has been given access can view the audit worksheets. This data is only intended for coder education and administrative staff to score how the coder is doing in a report card. The coder will be able to view the audit viewer and add notes/comments back to the auditor, but the coder will not be able to make any changes to the audit worksheet</description>
