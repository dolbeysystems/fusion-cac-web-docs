<h1 id="auditor-user-guide">Auditor User Guide</h1>

<p>The audit worksheet is a comprehensive module designed to streamline and enhance the coder audit
process. With its automated functionality, this tool efficiently compares coder-assigned codes to
auditor-assigned codes, generating audit outcomes for various aspects including code accuracy, POA
(Present on Admission) changes, abstraction correctness, and DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group)
adjustments.</p>
<p>Beyond auditing, the module facilitates tracking of training recommendations, enabling continuous
improvement in coding accuracy and proficiency. Additionally, its built-in section for rebuttal workflow
tracking ensures transparent communication and resolution of discrepancies between auditors and
coders, ultimately fostering a collaborative and quality-driven coding environment.</p>
<p>The audit worksheet serves as an invaluable additional module within the coding infrastructure, offering
advanced capabilities to streamline and optimize the audit process. For those interested in exploring its
functionalities further, reaching out to the Subject Matter Expert (SME) team is highly encouraged. The
SME team stands ready to provide comprehensive insights and guidance on how this module can
enhance coding efficiency, accuracy, and overall workflow management within the organization.</p>

<h1 id="auditor-role">Auditor Role</h1>

<p>The audit module introduces a new role of an auditor. The role of an &ldquo;Auditor&rdquo; has the same privileges
as a &ldquo;Coder&rdquo; when it comes to account editing. In fact, an auditor is editing the final codes. If an auditor
or coder submits the account with an open audit, the audit will automatically be closed. The auditor can
route an account directly to the coder that last submitted (which triggers a save and close), and the
coder can rebut and route an account back to the audit (which also triggers a save and close).</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-e4a92cd6b3daca51d51afb37e4963f81" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Auditor Role" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/auditor-user-guide/auditor-role/image-304.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-e4a92cd6b3daca51d51afb37e4963f81"><img alt="Auditor Role" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow lightbox-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/auditor-user-guide/auditor-role/image-304.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This role allows for the end-user to have a separate code tree while importing the coder-assigned codes
so that they have something to start with. The auditor role has a companion viewer in the Navigation
Tree. This viewer allows the auditor to document the findings of an audit.</p>
<p>The pre-audit codes and DRG are displayed for easy reference by the auditor. The auditor conducts the
review and makes changes to the codes in the Assigned code tree. When finished, the auditor computes
for the DRG. This displays post-audit results next to the pre-audit results for easy comparison. The
changes made by the auditor during the review are automatically recorded within the statistics section
of the viewer.</p>

<h1 id="starting-an-audit">Starting an Audit</h1>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you have the role of an auditor and chart access of auditor.</li>
<li>Open a chart that has been submitted by a coder, you may get this chart from a worklist
or, by manually typing in an account number.</li>
<li>On the navigation tree you will notice a viewer called “Audit Worksheet”.
<a href="#R-image-3d9d5e45a2986cc0983441da56cd12fe" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Audit Worksheet" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/auditor-user-guide/starting-an-audit/image-306.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<li>Click on “Start Audit” to begin</li>
<li>Upon clicking on “start audit”, select your audit type
from the dropdown. This will be used for reporting on the types of audit you
performed, and this can also be used for workflow purposes.
<a href="#R-image-2c283e58e4e05c4297c24a50c662f643" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Start Audit" class="border nolazy lightbox shadow figure-image" src="/fusion-cac-web-docs/auditor-user-guide/starting-an-audit/image-305.jpg" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<li>The codes in the “assigned code” tree are the same codes initially submitted by the
coder, allowing the auditor to start the audit with the codes from the coder. The audit
viewer can be popped out onto a separate screen, allowing the auditor to have a screen
for reviewing the chart. By selecting “Show All” codes in the unassigned code tree, the
auditor is taken to the documents/documentation supporting that code. This will help
streamline the audit process.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Once the auditor has made changes and is completed with the audit, they can click “Update Codes”
which automatically calculates and populates the audit statistics section. There is a comment bubble
next to each code as well as the DRG for the auditor to enter any comment. Next to the codes a
symbol may display.
<ul>
<li>A green ‘plus’ sign will show if the code was added.</li>
<li>A red ‘minus’ sign will show if a code was deleted.</li>
<li>A orange up or down ‘arrow’ sign will appear if the code location has been changed, as
in a primary and secondary are swapped.

<li>The auditor can then re-submit the chart or route it back to the coder of record by using the
“Route to Coder” button in the top right corner of the audit worksheet. This will route the chart to
the coder’s “You” worklist for them to review and re-submit.

role that has been given access can view the audit worksheets. This data is only intended for coder
education and administrative staff to score how the coder is doing in a report card. The coder will be
able to view the audit viewer and add notes/comments back to the auditor, but the coder will not be
