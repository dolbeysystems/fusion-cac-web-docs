    <title>Auditor Role :: Fusion CAC Documentation</title>
    <link>https://example.org/auditor-user-guide/auditor-role/index.html</link>
    <description>The audit module introduces a new role of an auditor. The role of an “Auditor” has the same privileges as a “Coder” when it comes to account editing. In fact, an auditor is editing the final codes. If an auditor or coder submits the account with an open audit, the audit will automatically be closed. The auditor can route an account directly to the coder that last submitted (which triggers a save and close), and the coder can rebut and route an account back to the audit (which also triggers a save and close).</description>
