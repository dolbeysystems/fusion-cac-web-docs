This total does not include Reason for Visit as they are calculated separately. Visit Reasons Pre-Audit The total is the number of reason for visit diagnosis codes at the time the audit is started. This will only display on an outpatient chart. Diagnosis Codes Post- Audit The total is the number of diagnosis codes including principal, admit and secondary at the time the auditor selects the Update Codes button. This total does not include Reason for Visit as they are calculated separately. Visit Reasons Post-Audit The total is the number of reason for visit diagnosis codes at the time the auditor selects the Update Codes button. This will only display on an outpatient chart. Diagnosis Codes Edited This is the count of the total of edit actions by the auditor for admit and secondary codes once the auditor selects the update codes button. An edit is defined as a simple change to the same code category such as the last digit of a code however if the auditor replaced the full code this is still counted as an edit rather than an unassign and an add. The editing action is defined by right clicking on a code from the assigned code tree and selecting edit diagnosis code with a replacement diagnosis code. This total does not include Reason for Visit as they are calculated separately. Diagnosis Codes Unassigned This is the count of the total of deleted or unassign actions by the auditor for admit and secondary codes once the auditor selects the update codes button. The unassign action is defined by right clicking on a code from the assigned code tree and selecting one of the unassign diagnosis code, unassign as secondary, unassign as admit or by selecting edit diagnosis code and deleting the code.
