    <description>Field Field Description Procedure Codes Pre-Audit The total is the number of procedure codes including principal and secondary at the time the audit is started. Procedure Codes Post-Audit The total is the number of procedure codes including principal and secondary at the time the auditor selects the Update Codes button. Procedure Codes Edited This is the count of the total of edit actions by the auditor for principal and secondary codes once the auditor selects the update codes button. An edit is defined as a simple change to the same code category such as the last digit of a code however if the auditor replaced the full code this is still counted as an edit rather than an unassign and an add. The editing action is defined by right clicking on a code from the assigned code tree and selecting edit procedure code with a replacement procedure code. Procedure Codes Unassigned This is the count of the total of deleted or unassign actions by the auditor for principal and secondary codes once the auditor selects the update codes button. The unassign action is defined by right clicking on a code from the assigned code tree and selecting one of the unassign principal code, unassign as secondary, unassign all episodes or by selecting edit procedure code and deleting the code. Procedure Codes Added This is the count of the total of added or assign actions by the auditor for principal and secondary codes once the auditor selects the update codes button. The assign action is defined by right clicking on a code from the unassigned code tree and selecting assign as principal or secondary, right clicking on a code to validate from a document or adding a code that did not exist previously. Principal PCS Changed This is a true or false field. If the principal PCS was changed from the previous code assignment the field will result in true which is counted as one error and if it was not changed it will result in false which is not counted as an error. N/A is available in the event the auditor wants to list it as not applicable to the audit. Procedure Errors This is the total codes that appear in the above boxes the formula is as followed: Procedure Errors = Procedure Codes Added + Procedure Codes Edited + Procedure Codes Unassigned + Principal PCS Changed. Procedure Error Rate This is the total codes that appear in the above boxes the formula is as followed: Procedure Error Rate = Procedure Codes Added + Procedure Codes Edited + Procedure Codes Unassigned + Principal PCS Changed/ Procedure Codes Pre-Audit. Procedure Accuracy Rate This is the total codes that appear in the above boxes the formula is as followed: Procedure Error Rate = (Procedure Codes Added + Procedure Codes Edited + Procedure Codes Unassigned + Principal PCS Changed/ Procedure Codes Pre-Audit) â€“ 100%.</description>
