    <description>The following table contains a list of all standard fields available.&#xA;Display Name Field Description Abstract Patient Class This is the abstraction Patient Class for the patient chart.

Active Matched Criteria Groups This is the total number of active criteria groups on a patient chart. Added to Images This is how many total codes were added to an image document. Admit Date This is the admit date of the patient. Even though the field is named admit date time it only displays the date. Admit Date w/ Time Computed to display the patient’s admit date with the admit time Admit Diagnosis Codes This is the admit diagnosis code of the patient chart. Admit Reason This is the admit reason which comes from ADT. Admit Source This is the admit source of the patient chart. Admit Type This is the admit type on the patient chart. Admitting Physician Computed to display the first physician name with a role of Admitting. Admitting Physician ID Computed to display the first physician ID with a role of Admitting. Age in Years Computed to display the patient’s age in years. Assigned CPT Code This is used to search for a chart with an assigned CPT code.

These fields contain numbers zero or higher or blank to indicate the number of days to add to the discharge date (current date is there is no discharge date) to calculate what is basically a billing due date. The billing date is compared to the current date (or the last submitted date if the account is already submitted) to compute the “Billing Countdown” – the number of days left to submit an account. If an account has no payor, no matching payor mapping, or payor mapping with no “bill days” defined, the “default bill days” is used (zero if “default bill days” is blank as well.)
