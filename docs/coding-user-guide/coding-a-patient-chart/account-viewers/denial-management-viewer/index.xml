    <description>Denial management tracking involves monitoring cases where a patientâ€™s submitted billing chart is rejected by the payer. Various reasons, such as medical necessity, code, or DRG assignment, could lead to these denials. This tool is designed to comprehensively record the specifics related to denial management and tracking. It is capable of documenting multiple denials for each chart, with the ability to log and categorize them for the purpose of tracking, managing workflows, and generating reports.</description>
