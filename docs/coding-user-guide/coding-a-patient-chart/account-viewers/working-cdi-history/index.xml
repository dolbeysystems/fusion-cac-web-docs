    <description>The working CDI History can be used to look at historical working DRG calculations. The coders cannot edit this information, but they can review the data.&#xA;The first calculated DRG will assume the Baseline DRG role, which is used to calculate the CDI impact on a chart. If you wish to change the Baseline DRG, you can click the “Set Baseline DRG” button.&#xA;Adding an Alternative Working DRG You can also indicate which Working DRGs are an alternative DRG for reconciliation. By checking the box next to each DRG, you are approving it as an alternative DRG to auto-reconcile the chart. You can manually add an additional DRG if it does not appear in the list.</description>
