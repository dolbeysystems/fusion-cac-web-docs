    <description>Admit Reason This is the reason that registration has typed in; this is not the admit reason set by the coder. That information is displayed in the Admit Dx Code field.&#xA;Category A category is a ‘Dolbey’ created field that is used to further specify a patient type, if applicable. At some sites, category might equal patient type while others may have a category that is comprised of multiple fields to create that category. For example, if you would like to report on how many charts a coder completed for inpatient and then define them by LOS, you then have a category to define the difference between LOS patient types or service lines.</description>
