| Principal Dx Changed        | This is a true or false field. If the principal diagnosis was changed from the previous code assignment the field will result in true which is counted as one error and if it was not changed it will result in false which is not counted as an error. N/A is available in the event the auditor wants to list it as not applicable to the audit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
