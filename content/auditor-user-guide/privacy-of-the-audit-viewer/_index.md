The auditor will need to add the coder of record so that the coder of record, any auditor, or other user
role that has been given access can view the audit worksheets. This data is only intended for coder
education and administrative staff to score how the coder is doing in a report card. The coder will be
able to view the audit viewer and add notes/comments back to the auditor, but the coder will not be
able to make any changes to the audit worksheet
