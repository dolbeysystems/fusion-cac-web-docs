The audit module provides comprehensive functionality designed to streamline and enhance the coder audit
process. With its automated functionality, this tool efficiently compares coder-assigned codes to
auditor-assigned codes, generating audit outcomes for various aspects including code accuracy, POA
(Present on Admission) changes, abstraction correctness, and DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group)
adjustments.

Beyond auditing, the module facilitates tracking of training recommendations, enabling continuous
improvement in coding accuracy and proficiency. Additionally, its built-in section for rebuttal workflow
tracking ensures transparent communication and resolution of discrepancies between auditors and
coders, ultimately fostering a collaborative and quality-driven coding environment.

The audit component serves as an invaluable additional module within the coding infrastructure, offering
advanced capabilities to streamline and optimize the audit process. For those interested in exploring its
functionalities further, please reach out to Dolbey's Subject Matter Expert (SME) team (smeteam@dolbey.com). The
SME team stands ready to provide comprehensive insights and guidance on how this module can
enhance coding efficiency, accuracy, and overall workflow management within the organization.
