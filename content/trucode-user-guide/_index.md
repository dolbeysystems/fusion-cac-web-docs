While Fusion CAC is encoder agnostic, some organizations choose to use the TruCode Encoder Essentials embedded in the application. 

TruCode Encoder Essentials is comprised of three controls: the CodeBooks control, the Research control, and the References control. 

- [CodeBooks](https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/trucode-user-guide/codebooks/) – The CodeBooks control is used to search for ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, CPT, and HCPCS codes. You can search the code books by terms or code.
- Research – The Research control is composed of four panes:
  - DRG Analysis – This pane suggests alternate DRGs for an encounter based upon the current DRG, codes present in the encounter, and the patient status.
  - ICD-10 – This pane lists ICD-10 equivalent codes for ICD-9 codes and ICD-9 equivalent codes for ICD-10 codes for educational purposes.
  - [Research](https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/trucode-user-guide/research/) – This pane lists references for a given code, as well as coding advice, crosswalk (a linking between ICD-9-CM procedure codes and CPT codes), and anesthesia crosswalk (a linking between surgical CPT and anesthesia CPT codes).
  - Edits – This pane shows edits for a coded encounter.
- [References](https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/trucode-user-guide/references/) – The References control contains the following references which can be searched, and some of which can also be browsed.
  - AHA Coding Handbook
  - Coders’ Desk Reference for Procedures
  - Coding Clinic® (ICD-9-CM, HCPCS, and ICD-10-CM/PCS)
  - CPT® Assistant
  - Drug Data (Micromedex)
  - Interventional Radiology
  - Medical Dictionary (Dorland)
  - Merck Manual Professional
