The CodeBooks control is used to search for codes by terms or code. You can use the code books to locate codes and post them to encounters, or simply to view a code with its surrounding notes and codes in a code book. The following code books are included in the CodeBooks control:

- ICD-10-CM Diagnosis and External Cause – These books consist of an alphabetic index where you can look up terms and a tabular of codes which includes all instructional notes.
- ICD-10-PCS Procedure – This book consists of an alphabetic index where you can look up terms and a table where you choose the specifics of the procedure to construct the ICD-10-PCS procedure code.
- ICD-9-CM Diagnosis, E Code, and Procedure – These books consist of an alphabetic index where you can look up terms and a tabular of codes including all instructional notes.
- CPT and HCPCS – In these books, both the index and tabular are searched simultaneously and tabular results are displayed based upon the search.

### About the Indexes

When searching a code book by terms (except for the CPT and HCPCS books), the alphabetic index is searched and appears in the control. The following elements are shown:

- Search Results pane – This pane displays all index entries from the alphabetic index that match the search terms.
- Context bar – This bar shows the alphabetic index location of the index entry selected in the Detail pane. The Context bar changes when you focus on a different entry in the Detail pane.
- Detail pane – This pane displays the alphabetic index for the index entry selected in the Search Results pane.

The display includes the following features:

- Backward and forward navigation – Click   to move back and   to move forward through the codes you have viewed.
- Subterm search – A subterm search searches through the subterms of a selected term. This is useful when there is a long list of subterms, you can use the subterm search rather than scrolling through the long list to find the subterm for which you are searching. 
- Shortcuts – Keyboard shortcuts are available for some actions in the encoder. For example, you can press Ctrl + ↑ and Ctrl + ↓to move the cursor though the fields and panes. For a complete listing for keyboard shortcuts, see Keyboard Shortcuts on page 23.
- Find All search – A Find All search looks for terms outside of the structure of the index. The search results display all occurrences of the terms in the code book that is searched. See Searching for All Occurrences of a Term on page 22 for more information.
- Table search – You can search the Hypertension table, Neoplasm table, and the Table of Drugs and Chemicals. 
  - Hypertension table – In the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code book, this table lists diseases due to hypertension.
  - Neoplasm table – In the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis code books, this table lists anatomical sites alphabetically, with columns to indicate the code for each behavior type, such as primary, secondary, benign, etc.
  - Table of Drugs and Chemicals – In the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis code books, this table contains a classification of drugs and chemicals to identify poisoning states and external causes of adverse effects.
- See and See Also cross-references – The indexes include See and See also instructions which are cross-references to other areas of the index.
- Synonym search – Synonyms are acronyms, abbreviations and shortcuts you can use to search the alphabetic index. Performing a search using a Synonym is the same as a search using terms. The Synonyms list contains a list of Synonyms that can be used in a search.
- Custom index lines – Custom index lines are alphabetic index entries that have been added to the official ICD-9-CM indexes. These entries are noted with the   symbol before the alphabetic index line.
