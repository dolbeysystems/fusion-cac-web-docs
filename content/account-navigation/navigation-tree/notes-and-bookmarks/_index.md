Notes & Bookmarks becomes visible in the center viewer after clicking on the hyperlink from the [Navigation](https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/general-user-guide/account-screen/#navigation-pane) tree.  This viewer presents a summary and chronological history of all notes and bookmarks added to an account. Users can expand the width of the Code Summary viewer by clicking on the arrow in the top right corner of the viewer.

Account Notes also have formatting options for text. Highlighting the text displays a pop-up with formatting options. A user can now select text in those areas and can change the styles of text.

Users have the option to make notes publicly visible among all users by clicking on the checkbox. Even if an end user marks a note/bookmark as private, users with the role of administrator or manager can still see private comments. This feature allows for a manager to review a patient chart and if they do not want the existing public note to show in the account note, they can change an existing note to private without putting in a new note.  Then they have to make it public, then switch it to private in order to have the account note blank. 

To keep your Comment box open while continuing to work on the chart, click on the Minimize Editor button. This will move a placeholder to the Accounts Action Bar.
