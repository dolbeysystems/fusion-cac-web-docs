The Code Summary is the last viewer to be reviewed prior to chart submission. This screen shows a summary of activity on the account and provides activity buttons to **Claim Ownership**, **Show History**, and **Print Summary** *(if a printer is configured)*. This viewer also provides information on Current Owner, First Coder, Last Saver, and Last Submitter. Users can expand the width of the Code Summary viewer by clicking on the arrow in the top right of the viewer.

### Show History

Upon opening Show History, users will see the entire history from a birds-eye view.  The user has the option of using the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons to expand or collapse the timeline.  The Zoom Fit will bring the visual timeline back to its original collapsed grid.  Hover over any of the event boxes and the contents will be displayed. 

The legend can be found by clicking {{%button%}}Show Legend{{%/button%}} button to let the user know what the colors represent without having to hover over them.  When clicked, it will open the Legend and the button name will change to "Hide Legend".  Click again to close.

## Final Code Summary

![Final Code Summary Viewer](FinalCodeSumViewer.png)

The Final Code Summary will only be available once the facility Coder clicks the {{%button%}}Submit{{%/button%}} button. This provides transparency between CDI and physician coding teams (if also using Fusion CAC) as to what was coded. When a submitted chart is open again, users will see a new viewer under the navigation menu called the Final Code Summary. This will display what the coders coded along with code status details and sequencing. This data is viewable only for the role of [‘CDI’](https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/cdi-user-guide/).  

![Final Code Summary](FinalCodeSummary.png)

Clicking on the header will expand the selection to display the codes that were coded and DRG/APC, if applicable. Any codes with a plus (+) sign indicates the code has not been added to the account. The plus (+) sign *does not indicate* that the code needs to be added. It is for the user to quickly add the code if they determine it is needed using coding judgment and supporting documentation. If applicable, the code’s HCC designation will show the HCC number and its version.


## Physician Coding Summary

The Physician Code Summary will display if the *Physician Coders* are also coding within Fusion CAC, and they submit the chart. This provides transparency between the facility and physician coding teams as to what was coded.
