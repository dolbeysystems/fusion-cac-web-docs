Clicking on the **Accounts** tab at the top of the screen allows users access to accounts in the system. Click anywhere on the row of the selected account to open it.


## Account List

 The main view for a workgroup is called the **Account List**. Account list displays accounts that need to be worked by the user. 

Accounts are commonly sorted into workgroups based on criteria set by the operational/management team. Each workgroup is a list of work that needs to be completed by users assigned to the workgroup. 

![](AccountList.png)

To access assigned worklists, click on the down arrow to the right of
the {{%button%}}Assigned to{{%/button%}} button to view the list of assigned
workgroups. Each of the user's assigned worklist will be listed along with a bubble showing the number of accounts in the group ready for coding. Once all the charts from a worklist have been worked, the list will not display in the {{%button%}}Assigned to{{%/button%}} dropdown until there are one or more charts to work.

> [!note]
If there are no workgroups in the drop-down, ensure the drop-down menu to
the left of {{%button%}}Assigned to{{%/button%}} says **Accounts**. If it does,
contact your {{%icon icon="user-tie"%}} supervisor.


If you want more information on how your workgroups are set up or why you are
assigned to a particular workgroup, you should contact your {{%icon icon="user-tie"%}} supervisor.

### {{%icon icon="sort"%}} Sorting and  {{%icon icon="filter"%}} Filtering

Once you have selected a workgroup, a list of accounts will appear in the grid. The displayed grid can be customized by using the column menu settings to pin, auto size, sort, filter, and select columns to display. Columns can also be re-ordered by clicking and dragging the column headings. These setting are custom and "sticky", meaning they can be set per user and remembered for future logins.

![Column Filter Options](FilterOptions.png)

Using the Filter Menu allows users to narrow down and isolate the accounts to be worked based on the data elements within the selected column. For example, the Filter Menu for the D/C Date column allows you to filter the account list by selected dates using the checkboxes or entering specific dates in the Search box. A Filter icon in front of the column heading means that a filter has been applied. 

![Filtered Column](FilteredDC.png)

To remove any selected filters, click on the Filter button and then check the box for (Select All) to remove all filters. 
When filtering columns, use the ‘Reset Filter’ button to remove filters vs. removing the filter from the column its self.
