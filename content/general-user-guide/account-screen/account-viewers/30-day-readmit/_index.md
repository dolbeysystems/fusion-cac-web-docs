If the patient has been readmitted within 30 days of the admit date, the patient demographic data will display below from the previous stay. If the previous stay was also coded, you will see the code.summary display below. If a check mark appears next to the code, this indicates the code on the previous stay was also suggested for the current stay.

![Readmission Summary Viewer](ReadmissionSummary.png)

If an account has multiple re-admissions, they will all show if they are in the default time of 30 days.  A setting can be changed to allow the number of days to be customized.  If the setting is updated to an amount other than 30, that new amount will show in the Re-admission Viewer AND in the red tag in the banner. *Please contact Support (cacsupport@dolbey.com) to have the setting configured, if desired.*
