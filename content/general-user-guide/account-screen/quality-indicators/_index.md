## Quality Module

This module allows for the ability to identify PDI, PSI, Quality Measure PC-06 and the Elixhauser Measures. 

#### PSI Indicators

The PSI Module uses the PSI technical specification from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov.

Fusion CAC uses the final codes assigned by coders along with other patient data that meet each PSI
guideline. Fusion CAC provides an indicator on the banner bar to a coder when codes coupled with
patient demographics meet a PSI guideline.

The PSI is reported in one of two
fields CDI PSI Indicator or PSI Indicator if identified by a coder. The indicator can be used for workflow
and/or reporting.

#### PDI Indicator

The PDI Module uses the PDI technical specification from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov.

The Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) focus on potentially preventable complications and iatrogenic
events for pediatric patients treated in hospitals and on preventable hospitalizations among pediatric
patients, taking into account the special characteristics of the pediatric population.

The PDI is reported in one of
two fields CDI PDI Indicator or PDI Indicator if identified by a coder. The indicator can be used for
workflow and/or reporting.


#### PC-06 Indicator

The Quality Measure Module supports the PC06 measure and uses the Joint Commission technical
specification https://manual.jointcommission.org/releases/TJC2018B/MIF0393.html.

Fusion CAC uses the final codes assigned by coders along with other patient data that meet each PC-06
guideline. Fusion CAC provides an indicator on the banner bar to a coder when codes coupled with
patient demographics meet a PC-06 guideline. The indicator can be used for workflow and/or reporting.


#### Elixhauser Comorbidity Measure Indicator

The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes. The indicator can be used for workflow
and/or reporting.
