Documents presented in Fusion CAC should be reviewed to determine the specific reason for the encounter and the conditions treated.  Codes can be validated through document review from the Documents Pane or code review from the Unassigned Codes pane.  Codes can also be added manually via direct code entry or through use of an interfaced encoder. 

Validating a Code
Codes can be validated/added to the chart as Assigned Codes as you are reviewing documents and the suggested codes within the document.
