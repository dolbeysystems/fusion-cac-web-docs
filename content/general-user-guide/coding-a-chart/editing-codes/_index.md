To edit an existing or suggested code, left click on the code to bring up the encoder and Code Editor windows.  If you are set up with dual monitors, you can move the encoder window to the second monitor and keep it open as you work through validation of each the engine suggested codes. From the Code Editor window, you can update the code from the code drop-down menu, via Direct Entry, or Encoder.  You can also validate/update the POA indicator and validate/update the code status (Admit, Principal, or Secondary).
If you wish to change the code, place your curser in the drop-down box where the code you wish to change is displayed. You can remove, for example, the .9 and replace it with the code extension that you need vs. entering the entire code. 

You also have the option to minimize and restore the Code Editor window to continue viewing documents or other areas of the chart as you are working to complete additional details for the procedure code.

Adding Procedure Code Data
Procedure codes typically require additional information for Physician and Date of Service for the procedure indicated along with procedure details. These fields are configured according to facility requirements and may look different in your version of Fusion CAC.
To enter in a date and physician to the procedure codes, right-click on the procedure code and then select Edit Procedure Info from the menu. After selecting a procedure code, the Code Editor window for the selected procedure code will open.
Add Procedure Date
To enter the procedure date, start entering the date in MM/DD/YYYY format or click on the calendar to select the procedure date. 
Add Physician
To add the physician, click into the Add physician… drop-down menu. Start entering the name of the physician who completed the procedure, then select the physician’s name to complete this field. You will need to enter in at least 3 characters of the physician’s last name to view the drop-down listing. Continue entering characters of the physician’s last name to narrow the listing of physicians to choose from. 
Add Additional Procedure Details
Click on the ellipsis button under the Action heading indicated with the (…).  This button allows you to add in additional procedure details.

Code Sequencing
There are multiple ways to re-sequence codes that have been validated and added to a chart:
•	Sequence using existing Encoder
•	Sequence using CAC Controls
Best practice recommendation is to re-sequence codes using the existing encoder.  Do this by clicking the Compute button and launching the encoder.
Code Sequencing and Grouping through Encoder
 
After clicking the Compute button, all patient demographic information and validated codes are uploaded to the existing encoder. Use the encoder to re-sequence codes, complete grouping, and complete the encoder session to return the computed grouping and re-sequenced codes to Fusion CAC. From here you will be directed to the Code Summary page for review of Validation Results (and resolution or errors), Assigned Diagnosis Codes, and Assigned Procedure Codes.
Code Sequencing with CAC
If grouping and billing edits are not required, codes can be re-sequenced by dragging and dropping codes within the Assigned Codes Pane.
Left click and hold the code to be re-sequenced, then move it to the new sequence location and release.
Note that TruCode users have the option to perform an encoder calculation without automatically resequencing the assigned codes on an as-needed basis. 
In the dropdown menu on the right-side of the "Compute" button, the "Compute w/o Resequence" menu will perform the encoder computation but leave all diagnosis codes in their original position. This feature will enable sites to re-sequence codes above a certain position.


Computing a DRG/Grouping
Use the Compute button to launch the encoder and proceed with confirmation of codes and sequencing to complete grouping and return the computed grouping and codes to Fusion CAC.
 
Mass Editing Codes
Mass editing of codes can be accessed by right clicking and selecting “Edit All Codes” on any of the code headers such as assigned diagnosis, assisted procedures, admit diagnosis. 
Each code has a checkbox, and each section has an ‘ALL’ checkbox.  If the user clicks the All checkbox, a checkmark will appear in all codes under it.  Any change made to one of those checked codes will be reflected in all other checked codes.  Note that you can update PCS and CPT codes together. If there is a check mark, the change will be made to both the CPT and the Procedure Code.  When both CPT and Procedure are selected together, only the Physician and Date can be changed.    
The CPT code section has a Modifier column with a plus sign.  Clicking the plus will open up the details window to add/change Modifier, plus other items that are included in that window.  Clicking on the ellipsis symbol next to the Episode field will also open the details. The user can add up to 4 modifiers, unless they are using the 3M™ Coding and Reimbursement System (CRS) then they will be able to add upto 5 modifiers.
 
 



 
Add Another Episode
Right clicking on a procedure allows you at add another instance of the same procedure without needing to duplicate the effort of recoding the procedure. 
From Edit Procedure Info, you can also update additional information for the selection of procedure codes to add procedure date, add physician, and update additional details (for example, Anesthesiologist, Anesthesia Type, Tissue Sample, Procedure Location, OR Minutes). These fields are configured according to facility requirements and may look different in your version of Fusion CAC.
