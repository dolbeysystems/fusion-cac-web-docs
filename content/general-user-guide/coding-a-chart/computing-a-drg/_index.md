### Code Sequencing

There are multiple ways to re-sequence codes that have been validated and added to a chart. Dolbey's recommendation is to re-sequence codes using the existing encoder. 


##### Code Sequencing and Grouping with Encoder
 
After clicking the Compute button, all patient demographic information and validated codes are uploaded to the existing encoder.

Use the encoder to re-sequence codes, complete grouping, and complete the encoder session to return the computed grouping and re-sequenced codes to Fusion CAC. From here you will be directed to the Code Summary page for review of Validation Results (and resolution or errors), Assigned Diagnosis Codes, and Assigned Procedure Codes.

##### Code Sequencing with CAC

If grouping and billing edits are not required, codes can be re-sequenced by dragging and dropping codes within the Assigned Codes Pane.
Left click and hold the code to be re-sequenced, then move it to the new sequence location and release.

>[!Note] **TruCode** users have the option to perform an encoder calculation *without* automatically resequencing the assigned codes on an as-needed basis. In the dropdown menu on the right-side of the "Compute" button, the "Compute w/o Resequence" menu will perform the encoder computation but leave all diagnosis codes in their original position. This feature will enable sites to re-sequence codes above a certain position.

### Computing a DRG/Grouping

Use the Compute button to launch the encoder and proceed with confirmation of codes and sequencing to complete grouping and return the computed grouping and codes to Fusion CAC.
