### Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are keys or key combinations allowing users to take certain action within the application without using their mouse.
The keyboard short cuts can be changed by an administrator in the [Shortcut Configuration](https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/administrative-user-guide/tools/shortcut-configuration/) tool.
