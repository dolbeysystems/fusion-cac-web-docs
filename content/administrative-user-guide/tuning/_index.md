The Dolbey Tuning Team is made up of credentialed medical coders, each with over 10 years of experience. Their job, primarily, is to work with the Dolbey FAE engine to ensure the Fusion CAC application is providing the most accurate code suggestions. It is the Tuning Teams responsibility to:

- **File Documents into the Correct Folders** - unsorted documents indicatie a unique document type that has not yet been seen by the application. The Tuning Team will need to train the engine on how to handle the document. Incorrect handling skews the accuracy/precision resulting in too many or not enough codes suggested to the coder. Once the team has decided on engine handling, they will then collect document headers to indicate where within the document the engine should or should not suggest codes.
  
- **Triage Customer Issues with Engine Results** - users can report questions and/or issues with code suggestions by emailing results@dolbey.com.
  
- **Analyze Engine Results** - dashboards within the application tell the Tuning Team what codes are regularly missed, suggested, and/or not used by end users allowing the team to tailor the engine per organization. 

By design, the FAE engine over codes. This means the FAE engine will code for everything including but not limited to diagnoses, procedures, allergies, medications, family history, past medical history, signs & symptoms as well as if thereâ€™s an injury how the injury was caused and where the injury occurred. Accuracy typically means how accurate and precise the FAE engine is at suggesting codes. However, since the application is over coding by design the Tuning Teams measures accuracy by how often the FAE engine misses a code causing coders to take manual action to add the code. This is as close to accuracy as Dolbey can get without splitting hairs trying to determine accuracy by site and state guidelines. This method of measring accuracy is used by other CAC vendors as well and is considered to be industry standard.

Any questions on code suggestions or document handling should be directed to the Tuning Team via email (results@dolbey.com).
