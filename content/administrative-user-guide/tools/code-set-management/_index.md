Code sets are groups of codes that users can save that they commonly use or are difficult to code. Codes
sets can be saved by topic to provide a quick code assignment. Code sets can be created at a
management level to push out to coders and/or users can create their own.

Code sets need to be regularly reviewed and updated by administrators to account for changes and expirations
in the ICD/CPT coding standards.
