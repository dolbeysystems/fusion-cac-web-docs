Query templates are frequently created and saved as a base template with most of the query written to
show as read only text. The creator can then add open fields for the user to add additional questions to
the base query template.

## Creating a Blank Query Template

If a Physician Query is exactly called “Blank Query Template” in the Form Designer then an additional
‘Query For’ field will appear for the user to enter plain text.
In applicable reports, the Query template column will show “Blank Query Template”: followed by the
value for the ”Query For” field.

## Verbal Query

You can request with CAC Support a verbal query template that will not be sent outbound. CAC Support
can add logic into the script so that when a template named “VERBAL QUERY” is used it will not be sent
outbound to the provider. To ensure you can still report on the topics of the query we would
recommend creating a template using the exact name “VERBAL QUERY” and then select the check box
Add Field For 'Query For'

If this box is checked, when the end users use this template to record the verbal query outcome they
will be presented with a box to add in what the query was for, it should be something like Sepsis or CHF
that follows the normal template names so the reporting is still available.
