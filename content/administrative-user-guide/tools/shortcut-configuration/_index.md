Shortcut keys offer a more efficient and convenient way to navigate and execute commands within the software.

Because some hotkeys may be mapped to a different software solution you are using, we allow you to 
configure our hotkeys. Default settings have been provided, but feel free to change them as needed.

To record a new hotkey combination, simply press the record button on the line of the function you wish to configure.
Enter in a button combination usually between 1-2 keys on the keyboard. For Example, ALT and F9
might submit the chart. Since we are a browser-based application, standard browswer hotkeys should not be used.
