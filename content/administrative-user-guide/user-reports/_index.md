a brief description. If you are looking for data that is not in user reports, consider account search to
create a custom search to export the raw data. User reports are meant to be run on-demand but, many
of the user reports can also be scheduled to be run at date/time interval. Since scheduled reports are
sent through email, no user reports that contain PHI is available therefore you will find the scheduled
reports do not contain all 47 however, most are available.
