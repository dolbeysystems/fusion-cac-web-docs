A chat room feature is available in most administrative tools, including User Management, Workflow Management, Validation Management, and Form Designer. This feature allows users to communicate in real-time while working within these tools.

The chat room is only active when multiple users are simultaneously accessing one of the administrative tools. Please note that the chat history resets upon logging off.
