User reports are canned reports that are preformatted reports below each of the report is outlined with
a brief description. If you are looking for data that is not in user reports, consider account search to
create a custom search to export the raw data. User reports are meant to be run on-demand but, many
of the user reports can also be scheduled to be run at date/time interval. Since scheduled reports are
sent through email, no user reports that contain PHI is available therefore you will find the scheduled
reports do not contain all 47 however, most are available.

engine versus added by text documents and non-text documents in addition to those that were added in
duplicate. This report card should be used as an educational opportunity to show possible
improvements for the end-user and/or code suggestions. This report is recommended to be used in
conjunction with an audit.

> [!note] Documents without codes not included in total
> The field "Total Documents" had to be constrained to count the total documents on the account with at

assigned codes by CDI broken down by code set along with how many codes were suggested by the
engine versus added by text documents and non-text documents in addition to those that were added in
duplicate. There is also a column to indicate of the codes manually added how many did the coder
assign for final code assignment. This report card should be used as an educational opportunity to show
