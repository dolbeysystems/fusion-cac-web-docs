The physician code summary will display if the physician coders are also coding within Fusion CAC, and
they submit the chart. This provides transparency between the facility and physician coding teams as to
what was coded.

By clicking on the header, it will expand the selection so you can see the codes that were coded. If you
see any codes with a plus (+) sign it means that you have not added this code to the account. The plus
(+) sign does not indicate that you need to add this code, it just allows you to quickly add the code if you
have determined you want to use this code using your coding judgment and supporting documentation.
