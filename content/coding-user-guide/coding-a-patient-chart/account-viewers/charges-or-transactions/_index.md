After the modifier is in the window, click on the check button to save the selected modifier. Continue this
process to add all applicable modifiers to charges in the Charges pane. The user can add up to 4
modifiers unless they are using the 3M CRS encoder, then they will be able to add up to 5 modifiers.

#### Assigning diagnosis codes to Hard Charges

A user with the role of a physician coder can now add assigned diagnosis codes along withphysicians and
CPT Modifier codes to hard charges listed in the Charges viewer. When a physician coder opens the
charges viewer, new columns with edit buttons will be seen.

Clicking on the edit button for the Diagnosis column will open a code field, which, when dropped down, will
list all assigned Diagnosis codes on the account. The physician coder can then select which diagnosis code 
to attach that hard charge. The Physician column edit button will open a physician field to allow the 
selection of a physician, and the Physician Modifiers column edit button will open a modifier window allowing 
modifiers to be selected. When launching the encoder, the physician coderâ€™s modifiers will be sent instead 
of the final modifiers on charge viewer.

> [!note] Physician Coding Module Required
You must have physician coding enabled to use this feature, if you do not have physician coding
please contact your account representative for more information.

#### Assigning a Pending Reason per Charge

Users that have a physician coder or single path coding role will have the ability to place a pending
reason per charge on the physician charges.

- If a charge is removed, then the pending reason would be removed.
- If a charge is updated, then the pending reason would not change.
