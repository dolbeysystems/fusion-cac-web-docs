## Setting a Note/Bookmark to Private

If an end user puts a note on the account, they can make it public or private. Even if an end user marks a
note/bookmark as private users that have a role of administrator or manager can still see private
messages. The private note/bookmark is simply marked private from all other users that do not have the
role of administrator or manager. This feature allows for a manager to review a patient chart and if they
do not want the existing public note to show in the account note, they can change an existing note
private without putting in a new note. Then they have to make it public, then switch it to private in
order to have the account note blank.
