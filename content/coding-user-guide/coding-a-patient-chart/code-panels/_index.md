by the engine for validation. Left-clicking on the diagnosis code will take you to the location within the
document that prompted the code suggestion.

### Procedure Codes

Under unassigned Diagnosis Codes are listed all unassigned **Procedure Codes** that have been suggested
by the engine for validation. Left-clicking on the procedure code will take you to the location within the
document that prompted the code suggestion.

### CPT® Codes

![Assigned Codes](image-255.jpg)

The Assigned pane sits above the Unassigned pane on the right-hand side of the
Account Screen. The Assigned pane includes Admit Diagnosis, Principal and/or
Visit Reasons Assigned Diagnoses, Principal and Secondary ICD-10 Procedures
and Assigned CPT® Codes. Once a coder validates a code from the document or
right clicks and assigned a code from the unassigned codes menu, they will
appear in the assigned codes pane. All codes on submit within this pane will go
outbound to your abstraction or billing system. Codes can be removed from
here by right-clicking and selecting unassign.

Codes falling below the 25th position will display within a light purple color.

### Code Editor

This is an additional quicker way to open the Code Editor dialog via the right-click menu right from the
assigned code tree. When clicking on the code from the assigned code tree you will edit only the code
along with the position you have clicked on. However, if you use the hot key from the unassigned code
tree you will open a full code editor, since no action has been assigned yet to that code.

The user can view all codes suggested by the engine within the Unassigned Codes pane. This allows the 
user to view each code with a link to the documentation and context of words and phrases which prompted
the code suggestion.

If the code has a plus sign to the left of the code, there are codes within the document for review
and validation.

### Allow Coders to hide CDI added codes

If a CDI adds a code to a document, this can now be hidden by the
Coder. When the Coder opens the account, a new box in the
Unassigned Codes Pane will be viewable. When checked, any code
added to a document by a CDI will be hidden from the list.

in the Show All codes tree. In this example, the code was assigned on the Consultation document type. Please
note, this may not be retroactive.
