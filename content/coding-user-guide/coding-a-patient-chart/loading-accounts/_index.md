Filter Menu for the D/C Date column allows you to filter the account listing by
selected dates using the checkboxes or entering specific dates in the Search
box.

## {{% icon icon="sort" %}} Sorting Accounts within a Single Column

Sorting work queue columns is an integral part of workflow. By sorting
information in the assigned accounts grid, you can see data the way you want
and find accounts quickly. You can sort data by text
({{%icon icon="arrow-down-a-z"%}} or {{%icon icon="arrow-down-z-a"%}}),
numbers ({{%icon icon="arrow-down-1-9"%}} or {{%icon icon="arrow-down-9-1"%}}),
and dates (oldest to newest and newest to oldest).

To sort a single column, click once on the column header of the column you want
to sort. The column header will change to an up arrow. This will sort the
column first in ascending order {{%icon icon="arrow-down-a-z"%}}. Click the
column header again to change to a descending {{%icon icon="arrow-down-z-a"%}}
sort with a down arrow.

| UI                                | Description     |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| ![Sort Ascending](image-093.png)  | Ascending Sort  |
| ![Sort Descending](image-094.png) | Descending Sort |

Clicking on the column heading a third time will return the column to the
default sort and the arrow will disappear

## {{% icon icon="arrow-down-wide-short" %}} Sorting Accounts for Multiple Columns

In the assigned accounts grid, you can select multiple columns for ascending
and descending sorts. For example, you can sort accounts by discharge date and
then by LOS to focus efforts on accounts with longer lengths of stay for a
specific discharge date. Sorting helps you to quickly visualize, organize, and
understand the Workgroup for effective decision making and finding the next
chart to be prioritized for coding.

To sort multiple columns, click the column heading of the first column in your
selection, then hold down the SHIFT button while you the click the column
headings of other columns you want to add to the selection for sorting. Click
the column header for your sort selection (ascending, descending, default)
until the individual column is sorted in the preferred sort order. After all
selections have been made, release the keys for the sort results.

## {{% icon icon="hospital-user" %}} Accounts Button

In the top left corner of the application, click on the Accounts button to toggle between different account list views. The "Account List" view is the list of accounts of the workqueue you are in.

### {{% icon icon="share-from-square" %}} Assigned to

Workgroups will be assigned to a coder or group of coders for accounts to be
coded. Workgroups are listings of similar accounts grouped by specified
criteria. Accounts can reside in only one Workgroup at any given time. Each
coder will have different groups assigned. Check with your manager to
understand your own Workgroup assignment.

Click on the {{% button %}} Assigned to: {{% /button %}} button to display a
drop-down menu of assigned Workgroups. Next to each Workgroup name is a bubble

![Assigned To Menu](image-100.jpg)

system. Assigned Workgroups will not be visible here if there are no accounts
available for coding for that specific Workgroup.

### {{% icon icon="retweet" %}} Auto-Load

Checking the Auto-Load box before you start your session or when you are in an
assigned Workgroup will automatically load the next chart in the selected
Workgroup upon Save, Submit, or Cancel. You can discontinue Auto-Load at any

![Disconnect Auto-Load](image-101.png)

Fusion CAC is regularly reacting to account activity, submitting information to
the encoder, updating Workgroups, and receiving updated data to the EHR. When
you are working from the assigned accounts listing, from time to time you might
need to {{% icon icon="arrows-rotate" %}} refresh the data and update the
Workgroups with recent information.

To ensure that you have the most up-to-date information for accounts in your
assigned Workgroups, or when your current session of Fusion CAC has been idle
for an extended period, hit the {{%button%}}Refresh{{%/button%}} button to
update your session with recent activity.

> [!note] Avoid Browser Refresh
The **Refresh** button within Fusion CAC is different from the refresh button
