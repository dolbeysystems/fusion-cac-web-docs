## Coding a Patient Chart


<section style="display:flex">
<div style="flex: 1;"">

Upon opening the account for initial coding review, all the engine
suggested codes will be listed in the Unassigned pane on the right-hand
side under the Assigned Codes pane.

Codes are categorized by Diagnosis Codes, Procedure Codes, and then
CPTÂ® Codes.

From here, you can right-click on a code, then either Assign or
Edit/Assign the selected code.

Selecting Edit/Assign will open a window to review the code, code
description, set the POA indicator, and designate the code status as
Admit, Principal or Secondary.

Clicking OK after making these selections will then move the selected
code to the Assigned Codes pane.

Left-clicking on an Unassigned Code will open the relevant document in
the center document viewer and highlight instances of the suggested
code in yellow.

Continue reviewing all Unassigned Codes until all Assigned Codes have been validated with POA
indicator and status
