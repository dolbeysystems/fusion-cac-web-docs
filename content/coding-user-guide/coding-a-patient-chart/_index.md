## Coding a Patient Chart

Upon opening the account for initial coding review, all the engine
suggested codes will be listed in the Unassigned pane on the right-hand
side under the Assigned Codes pane.

![Code Tree](image-023.png)

Codes are categorized by Diagnosis Codes, Procedure Codes, and then
CPT® Codes.

From here, you can right-click on a code, then either Assign or
Edit/Assign the selected code.

Selecting Edit/Assign will open a window to review the code, code
description, set the POA indicator, and designate the code status as
Admit, Principal or Secondary.

Clicking OK after making these selections will then move the selected
code to the Assigned Codes pane.

Left-clicking on an Unassigned Code will open the relevant document in
the center document viewer and highlight instances of the suggested
code in yellow.

Continue reviewing all Unassigned Codes until all Assigned Codes have been validated with POA
indicator and status

## Reviewing Documents

Documents presented in Fusion CAC should be reviewed to determine the specific reason for the encounter and the
conditions treated. Codes can be validated through document review from the Documents Pane or code review from the
Unassigned Codes pane. Codes can also be added manually via direct code entry or through use of an interfaced encoder.


![Document Tree](image-031.png)

## Validating a Code

Codes can be validated/added to the chart as Assigned Codes as
you are reviewing documents and the suggested codes within
the document.

Right-click on the code to Edit/Assign the code.

## Code Highlighting

- If the background of the text suggestion has a purple background, the text matches a code suggestion.
- If the background of the text suggestion has a red background, the text matches only a secondary token.
- If the background of the code has a green background this means the code was already validated on a different document.

## Adding a Code

There are multiple ways you can add a code to a chart if it has not already been suggested by the engine
for validation:

- Suggested Code
- Add Code
- Add Code from Codebook


## Adding a Code to a Text Document

![Add Code](image-028.jpg)

After reviewing all suggested codes from either the Documents Pane or Unassigned Code Pane, you can
add a code to a text document by highlighting the relevant word(s) or phrase and then right-clicking to
open the Add Code menu. Left-click and drag the mouse to highlight the selected text for code addition, then right-click to
open the Add Code Menu.


## Suggested Code

![Suggested Code](image-034.jpg)

Left-click and drag the mouse to highlight the selected text for code addition, then right-click to open
the Add Code Menu. Click on “Suggested Code” to have Fusion CAC present any relevant code based on
the highlighted word or phrase. If the correct code appears in this list, clicking on it will add the code to
the document.

## Supporting Evidence

![Supporting Evidence](image-035.jpg)

This is defined as the components within the chart that were used to make up any suggested codes. The
customer might find it overwhelming on a complex chart but, if they understand what it’s there for it
will be more helpful that overwhelming.

In a nutshell, the supporting details help you understand why the engine suggested a code. If you click
on the down arrow next to the code it will show you the words/phrases it is linked to, to create the
code. This linkage will quickly tell you if the code is correct or if it tried to put two thoughts
together that didn’t belong together. If you click on the down arrow next to the code it will show
you the words/phrases is linked to, to create the code.

## Add Code (via Direct Entry)

Use Add Code when you know the code to be assigned and do not need the encoder.

![Add Code](image-036.jpg)

Click on the Add Code + sign to open the Code Editor window. Enter at least the first 2 characters of
the code to bring up the drop-down listing of available codes for the main term, then scroll down the
listing for codes to confirm the sub-term and select the appropriate code for complete coding.

From the Code Editor window, you can also confirm the code description, set the POA Indicator, and
designate the code as Admit, Principal or Secondary.

Alternatively, you may also enter the text description of the code and select the code that way.

> [!info]
> You can add either a Diagnosis or Procedure/CPT® code from the Code Editor window.

## Add Code from Encoder

You can add a code to a text document by highlighting the relevant word(s) or phrase and then right-
clicking to open the Add Code menu.

![Add Code](image-042.png)

Left-click and drag the mouse to highlight the selected text for code addition, then right-click 
to open the Add Code Menu.

Click on the Add Code from Encoder + sign to launch the Encoder. Continue to use the encoder and 
accept the final code which will be returned to your chart

![Add From Encoder](image-039.jpg)

## Adding a Code to a Scanned Document

Although the engine does not suggest codes from scanned documents, you can add codes to scanned
documents for codes not assigned elsewhere within the chart. *Adding codes to scanned documents is
recommended only when a code has not already been added to a text document within the chart or
documentation to be coded is not found elsewhere.*

![Add Code to Scanned Document](image-048.jpg)

To add a code to a scanned document, start typing the code in the **Add codes…** drop-down box or click on the
**Encoder** button in the bar above the scanned document.

Codes added to the scanned document will appear in the **Additional Codes** box

## Adding a Code from Codebook

You can add a code to a text document by highlighting the relevant word(s) or phrase and then right-clicking
to open the Add Code menu.

![Add From Codebook](image-045.png)

Left-click and drag the mouse to highlight the selected text for code addition, then right-click to open the 
Add Code Menu.

Click on **Add Code from Encoder** + to launch the Encoder. Continue to use the encoder and accept the final 
code which will be returned to your chart.

> [!info]
> The exact functionality of adding a code from encoder can vary depending on your facility settings
> and the encoder used. Please consult your manager if you need further instructions.

## Editing a Code

To edit an existing or suggested code, left click on the code to bring up the encoder and Code Editor
windows. If you are set up with dual monitors, you can move the encoder window to the second
monitor and keep it open as you work through validation of each the engine suggested codes. From the
Code Editor window, you can update the code from the code drop-down menu, via Direct Entry, or
Encoder. You can also validate/update the POA indicator and validate/update the code status (Admit,
Principal, or Secondary).

If you wish to change the code, place your curser in the drop-down box where the code you wish to
change is displayed. You can remove, for example, the .9 and replace it with the code extension that you
need vs. entering the entire code.

## Adding Procedure Code Data

Procedure codes typically require additional information for Physician and Date of Service for the
procedure indicated along with procedure details. These fields are configured according to facility
requirements and may look different in your version of Fusion CAC.

To enter in a date and physician to the procedure codes, right-click on the procedure code and then
select Edit Procedure Info from the menu. After selecting a procedure code, the Code Editor window for
the selected procedure code will open.

### Add Procedure Date

To enter the procedure date, start entering the date in MM/DD/YYYY format or click on the calendar to
select the procedure date.

### Add Physician

To add the physician, click into the **Add physician…** drop-down menu. Start entering the name of the
physician who completed the procedure, then select the physician’s name to complete this field. You
will need to enter in at least 3 characters of the physician’s last name to view the drop-down listing.
Continue entering characters of the physician’s last name to narrow the listing of physicians to choose
from.

![Add Physician](image-062.png)

### Add Additional Procedure Details

Click on the ellipsis button under the Action heading indicated with the (…). This button allows you to
add in additional procedure details.

## Code Sequencing

There are multiple ways to re-sequence codes that have been validated and added to a chart:

- Sequence using existing Encoder
- Sequence using CAC Controls

Best practice recommendation is to re-sequence codes using the existing encoder. Do this by clicking
the Compute button and launching the encoder.

### Code Sequencing and Grouping through Encoder

![Code Sequencing Encoder](image-074.jpg)

After clicking the **Compute** button, all patient demographic information and validated codes are
uploaded to the existing encoder. Use the encoder to re-sequence codes, complete grouping, and
complete the encoder session to return the computed grouping and re-sequenced codes to Fusion CAC.
From here you will be directed to the **Code Summary** page for review of Validation Results (and
resolution or errors), Assigned Diagnosis Codes, and Assigned Procedure Codes.

### Code Sequencing with CAC

If grouping and billing edits are not required, codes can be re-sequenced by dragging and dropping
codes within the Assigned Codes Pane.

Left click and hold the code to be re-sequenced, then move it to the new sequence location and release.

> [!info]
> TruCode users have the option to perform an encoder calculation without automatically
> resequencing the assigned codes on an as-needed basis.

![Code Sequencing](image-075.jpg)

In the dropdown menu on the right-side of the "Compute" button, the "Compute w/o Resequence" menu will
perform the encoder computation but leave all diagnosis codes in their original position. This feature 
will enable sites to re-sequence codes above a certain position.

## Computing a DRG/Grouping

Use the Compute button to launch the encoder and proceed with confirmation of codes and sequencing
to complete grouping and return the computed grouping and codes to Fusion CAC.

## Mass Editing Codes

Mass editing of codes can be accessed by right clicking and selecting “Edit All Codes” on any of the 
code headers such as assigned diagnosis, assisted procedures, admit diagnosis.

![Mass Edit](image-077.jpg)

Each code has a checkbox, and each section has an ‘ALL’ checkbox. If the
user clicks the All checkbox, a checkmark will appear in all codes under it. Any change made to one of
those checked codes will be reflected in all other checked codes. Note that you can update PCS and CPT
codes together. If there is a check mark, the change will be made to both the CPT and the Procedure
Code. When both CPT and Procedure are selected together, only the Physician and Date can be
changed.

The CPT code section has a Modifier column with a plus sign. Clicking the plus will open up the details
window to add/change Modifier, plus other items that are included in that window. Clicking on the
ellipsis symbol next to the Episode field will also open the details. The user can add up to 4 modifiers,
unless they are using the 3M™ Coding and Reimbursement System (CRS) then they will be able to add
upto 5 modifiers.

![Code Sequencing](image-076.jpg)

## Add Another Episode

Right clicking on a procedure allows you at add another instance of the same procedure without
needing to duplicate the effort of recoding the procedure.

![Add Another Episode](image-081.jpg)

From Edit Procedure Info, you can also update additional information for the selection of procedure
codes to add procedure date, add physician, and update additional details (for example,
Anesthesiologist, Anesthesia Type, Tissue Sample, Procedure Location, OR Minutes). These fields are
configured according to facility requirements and may look different in your version of Fusion CAC.


## Assigned Accounts Grid

### Column Settings

![Column Settings](image-084.png)

Each column within the Assigned Accounts Grid has menu options to pin, auto size, and reset columns as
well as a Tool Panel to select which columns you want displayed in your view of the assigned accounts
grid.

Click on the Menu icon to view the drop-down listing.

### Pin Column

![Pin Column](image-087.jpg)

The Pin Column feature will allow you to freeze certain columns to the right or left of your accounts 
grid pane. Doing so will keep these columns visible when you move to other areas of the assigned 
accounts grid.

To pin multiple columns, click on each column that you want to pin and select the menu option based on where
you would like to view the selected pinned column. Columns can be rearranged after they have been pinned
based on your view preferences. To unpin a column, select the Pin Column option from the menu and
choose No Pin.

### Auto size & Reset Columns

Within the assigned accounts listing, the default column width is based on the account with the data
field having the most characters. You can size individual columns or all columns to automatically fit the
width of contents of that particular column. To Auto size just one column, select the menu button for
the column, then select **Autosize This Column**. To automatically fit the width of contents for ALL
columns, select the menu button for any column, then select **Autosize All Columns**.

To return column widths to their default settings, select the menu button for any column, then select
**Reset Columns**.

### Tool Panel

The Tool Panel feature gives you the flexibility to customize the display of columns within your Assigned
Accounts Grid. In addition to the option of auto sizing columns to maximize what is displayed, you can
select/deselect column headings based on your preferences.

Click on Tool Panel from the Column Setting drop-down listing to view the Tool Panel selection menu.
You can select/deselect columns to be displayed and then click on Tool Panel again to hide the Tool
Panel selection menu.

## Grid Columns Fields

### Hide or Show Columns

You can choose which columns you want to view when displaying your assigned accounts listing by
clicking on the Columns icon in any column on your assigned accounts listing.

![Hide or Show Column](image-091.jpg)

Tool Panel settings will remain for all future coding sessions and subsequent logins.

To bring all columns back into view, click on **Reset Columns** from the Column Settings drop-down
listing.

### Filter Menu

Using the Filter Menu allows you to narrow down and isolate the accounts to be worked based on the
data elements within the selected column. For example, the Filter Menu for the D/C Date column allows
you to filter the account listing by selected dates using the checkboxes or entering specific dates 
in the Search box.

![Column Filter Menu](image-092.jpg)

A Filter icon in front of the column heading means that a filter has been applied.

To remove any selected filters, click on the Filter button and then check the box for **(Select All)** 
to remove all filters.

If you filter columns, you can use the ‘Reset Filter’ button to remove filters vs. removing 
the filter from the column its self.

![Column Filter Menu](image-088.jpg)

## Sorting Accounts within a Single Column

Sorting work queue columns is an integral part of workflow. By sorting information in the assigned
accounts grid, you can see data the way you want and find accounts quickly. You can sort data by text
(A to Z or Z to A), numbers (smallest to largest or largest to smallest), and dates (oldest to newest and
newest to oldest).

To sort a single column, click once on the column header of the column you want to sort. The column
header will change to an up arrow. This will sort the column first in ascending order (A-Z). Click the
column header again to change to a descending (Z-A) sort with a down arrow.

| UI                                | Description     |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| ![Sort Ascending](image-093.png)  | Ascending Sort  |
| ![Sort Descending](image-094.png) | Descending Sort |

Clicking on the column heading a third time will return the column to the default sort and the arrow will
disappear

## Sorting Accounts for Multiple Columns

In the assigned accounts grid, you can select multiple columns for ascending and descending sorts. For
example, you can sort accounts by discharge date and then by LOS to focus efforts on accounts with
longer lengths of stay for a specific discharge date. Sorting helps you to quickly visualize, organize, and
understand the Workgroup for effective decision making and finding the next chart to be prioritized for
coding.

To sort multiple columns, click the column heading of the first column in your selection, then hold down
the SHIFT button while you the click the column headings of other columns you want to add to the
selection for sorting. Click the column header for your sort selection (ascending, descending, default)
until the individual column is sorted in the preferred sort order. After all selections have been made,
release the keys for the sort results.

## Accounts Button

Click on the Accounts button to toggle between the Accounts view and Recent Views, or you can click on
the drop-down arrow to select between Account and Recent Views.

![Accounts Button](image-097.jpg)

### Assigned to

Workgroups will be assigned to a coder or group of coders for charts to be coded. Workgroups are
listings of similar accounts grouped by specified criteria. Accounts can reside in only one Workgroup at
any given time. Each coder will have different groups assigned. Check with your manager to understand
your own Workgroup assignment.

Click on the Assigned to: button to display a drop-down menu of
assigned Workgroups. Next to each Workgroup name is a bubble with
the number of charts in the Workgroup.

![Assigned To Menu](image-100.jpg)

> [!info]
> By default, a Workgroup must have at least one pending chart
> to display in the system. Assigned Workgroups will not be visible here
> if there are no accounts available for coding for that specific
> Workgroup.

### Auto-Load

Checking the Auto-Load box before you start your session or when you are in an assigned Workgroup
will automatically load the next chart in the selected Workgroup upon Save, Submit, or Cancel. You can
discontinue Auto-Load at any time by unchecking the Auto-Load box. This will return you to the
Assigned to Workgroup for manual selection of the next chart in the selected Workgroup.

> [!info]
> Note: Auto-load will load the next chart using the filters and sorts that you have applied to your
> Workgroup.

![Auto-Load NavBar](image-104.jpg)

Fusion CAC will automatically open the next account in your assigned Workgroup after you Cancel, Save
or Submit the current account.

To discontinue auto-loading of the next chart in your assigned Workgroup, you can click No when
presented with the Auto-Load Next Account? Window.

![Disconnect Auto-Load](image-105.png)

### Refresh Button

![Disconnect Auto-Load](image-101.png)

Fusion CAC is regularly reacting to account activity, submitting information to the encoder, updating
Workgroups, and returning data to the EMR. When you are working from the assigned accounts listing,
from time to time you might need to refresh the data and update the Workgroups with
recent information.

To ensure that you have the most up-to-date information for accounts in your assigned Workgroups, or
when your current session of Fusion CAC has been idle for an extended period, hit the Refresh button to
update your session with recent activity.

> [!info]
> The **Refresh** button within Fusion CAC is different from the refresh button in your browser. It is
> recommended that you NOT use the refresh button in your browser, as this will reload your session,
> resulting in a loss of your work.

### Loading a Specific Chart

If your facility has opted to use a workflow outside of Fusion CAC or the chart you wish to work on is not
in your assigned Workgroup, you can open a chart by entering the account number in the **Account #**
search box on the right side of the Account List Control Bar. Press ENTER after typing in the account
number to open the chart to the Account Screen.

![Loading a Specific Chart](image-106.png)

### Accounts Action Bar

The Accounts Action Bar will be visible after you open account from the Workgroup or manually enter it
from the Account # search box.

![Accounts Action Bar](image-107.jpg)

The Accounts Action Bar includes information on the account including:

- **Chart Status** - Unbilled, Submitted
- **Patient Type** - Inpatient, Outpatient, etc.
- **Account #**
- **Dates of Service** - From and Thru
- **Length of Stay** - based on current date or discharge date

The Accounts Action Bar also has Control Keys to **Compute** (accessing the encoder), **Cancel**, **Save**, or
**Submit** to complete work and close a chart.


| Action      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Compute** | Launches the encoder. This button should be used to Compute the DRG or view encoder Edits.
| **Cancel**  | This button will CANCEL any changes made to the account and return to the Assigned Accounts Listing for selection of a new account.
| **Save**    | This button will SAVE any changes made to the account during the current session and return to the Assigned Accounts Listing for selection of a new account.

### Quality Indicators Module

This module is an additional cost that adds on the ability to identify PSI, Quality Measure PC-06 and the
Elixhauser Measures. If you want to learn more about this quality module you can contact the SME team
for more details at smeteam@dolbey.com.

#### PSI Indicators

The PSI Module uses the PSI technical specification from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov.

Fusion CAC uses the final codes assigned by coders along with other patient data that meet each PSI
guideline. Fusion CAC provides an indicator on the banner bar to a coder when codes coupled with
patient demographics meet a PSI guideline.

This PSI indicator displays in the banner bar under the compute button. The PSI is reported in one of two
fields CDI PSI Indicator or PSI Indicator if identified by a coder. The indicator can be used for workflow
and/or reporting.

![PSI Indicators](image-114.jpg)

#### PDI Indicator

The PDI Module uses the PDI technical specification from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov.

The Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) focus on potentially preventable complications and iatrogenic
events for pediatric patients treated in hospitals and on preventable hospitalizations among pediatric
patients, taking into account the special characteristics of the pediatric population.

This PDI indicator displays in the banner bar under the compute button. The PDI is reported in one of
two fields CDI PDI Indicator or PDI Indicator if identified by a coder. The indicator can be used for
workflow and/or reporting.

The algorithm for the PDI on if it applied or not is within the code summary pane.

![PSI Indicators](image-116.jpg)

#### PC-06 Indicator

The Quality Measure Module supports the PC06 measure and uses the Joint Commission technical
specification https://manual.jointcommission.org/releases/TJC2018B/MIF0393.html.

Fusion CAC uses the final codes assigned by coders along with other patient data that meet each PC-06
guideline. Fusion CAC provides an indicator on the banner bar to a coder when codes coupled with
patient demographics meet a PC-06 guideline. The indicator can be used for workflow and/or reporting.

This field indicator displays in the banner bar under the compute button as shown below.

![PSI Indicators](image-117.jpg)

#### Elixhauser Comorbidity Measure Indicator

The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes. The indicator can be used for workflow
and/or reporting. This field indicator displays in the banner bar under the compute button as shown
below.

![PSI Indicators](image-118.jpg)

The algorithm to determine the Elixhauser measure can be found on the code summary at the bottom
under the assigned codes.

![PSI Indicators](image-119.jpg)

## Navigation Pane

![PSI Indicators](image-123.png)

The Navigation Pane sits above the Documents Pane on the left-hand side of the Account Screen. 
The Navigation Pane includes hyperlinks to pages within the chart providing summary views of
coding information, demographic information, as well as clinical documentation, workflow, and 
worksheets.

Any Navigation link highlighted in **{{< rawhtml >}}<span style="color:#a00">RED</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}**
indicates action items  required to finalize the chart or  additional information available for review and reference. 
**When the Code Summary link displays RED, there are validation errors on the chart that must be 
resolved prior to submission.**

Click on the **Add Document** button to add a document configured based on your user role.

> [!info]
> Document types available to be added are configured by system administrators.

### Code Summary

The Code Summary screen shows a summary of activity on the account and provides activity buttons to
**Claim Ownership**, **Show History**, and **Print Abstract** (if a printer is configured).

This pane also provides information on **Current Owner**, **First Coder**, **Last Saver**, and **Last Submitter**.

You can expand the width of the Code Summary pane by clicking on the right-arrow in the top right of the pane.

![PSI Indicators](image-120.jpg)

### Review Validation Results/Errors

The Code Summary link in the Navigation Pane will be highlighted in
**{{< rawhtml >}}<span style="color:#a00">RED</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}**
when there are validation result errors for review and resolution.

![Code Summary](image-128.jpg)

Any errors preventing submission of the chart will be highlighted in the box under Validation 
Results on the Code Summary screen. **Validation Results** flag “errors” within the chart that should 
be reviewed and validated before the chart is finalized and submitted for billing. The **Submit** 
button will be grayed out until errors have been resolved, including pending reasons that have 
been assigned.

![Code Summary Large](image-125.jpg)

Once all validations results are resolved, the Code Summary link in the Navigation Pane will return to
black and you can hit the Submit button to complete the chart.

#### Coding Summary (Abstract)

Code Summary is the last pane to be reviewed prior to chart submission. The three main sections of the
Code Summary pane for review include:

- Validation Results
- Pending Reasons

should be reviewed and cleared in order to finalize and submit an account for billing.

![Validation Results](image-140.png)

##### Pending Reasons

A historical listing of Pending Reasons assigned to the account can be found within the Code Summary
Pane below Validation Results.

Pending reasons are used when a chart cannot be completed or routed to another Workgroup. The
number of pending reasons selected is unlimited. Pending reasons will be different for each facility
based on system configuration specifications. Please contact your system administrator for definition
and use of available pending reasons.

You can add a Pending Reason to the account by clicking on the drop-down menu and selecting the
applicable Pending Reason. If your organization has selected to allow a physician to be tied to a pending
reason, you will be prompted to assign a physician to the pending reason, and you will see an additional
physician field in the list of pending reasons, as illustrated below.

> [!info]
> If physicians have been turned on for pending reasons, not all pending reasons may be tied to a
> physician. This option is set within the mapping configuration.

![Pending Reasons](image-135.jpg)

If a pending reason is added to an account, the Submit button will be grayed out and unavailable. Click
on the Save button to save all changes and exit the chart. Charts with pending reasons will stay within
the existing Workgroup until the Pending Reason is removed. Pending Reasons can also be
deleted/removed from accounts by clicking on the next to the Pending Reason to be removed.

##### Pending Reason Notes

On any account, an edit button will now appear to the left of the pending reason. Clicking that button
will drop down a note entry where the user can record a note. Pressing ENTER will record the note. Keep
in mind that a note can be deleted by clicking a trash can symbol to its left. In Account Search, the
"Pending Reasons" drill down will now include the "Note" field.

![Pending Reasons Notes](image-136.jpg)

### Account Information

The **Account Information** pane summarizes patient demographic information (based on system
configuration) with data captured for purposes of state and/or registry reporting.

You can expand the width of the Code Summary pane by clicking on the right arrow in the top right 
corner of the pane. To update data fields in the Account information pane, click on the blue button 
and select the appropriate selection from the drop-down menu.

![Account Information](image-144.jpg)


#### Unspecified Code Edit Flag

On
[April 1, 2022 CMS made the Unspecified Code Edit](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/mm12471-april-2022-update-java-medicare-code-editor-mce.pdf)
effective. This new edit is triggered when a code from the unspecified code list is assigned by a coder.
It is the provider’s responsibility to determine if a more specific code from that subcategory is available
in the medical record documentation by a clinical provider.

If additional information to identify the laterality from the available medical record documentation by any
other clinical provider is unable to be obtained or there is documentation in the record that the physician
is clinically unable to determine the laterality because of the nature of the disease/condition, then the
provider must enter that information into the remarks section.


Specifically, the provider may enter **“UNABLE TO DET LAT 1”** to identify that they are unable to obtain
additional information to specify laterality or they may enter **“UNABLE TO DET LAT 2”** to identify that the
physician is clinically unable to determine laterality. If not entered, the claim will be returned.

Dolbey can support the addition of this field to your account information viewer and send the necessary
information, known as the billing note, downstream if required. If this is something that you need, please
reach out to the Dolbey SME Team at smeteam@dolbey.com. Below is an example of what it could look
like in the account information viewer.

![Unspecified Code Edit Flag](image-145.jpg)

### Notes & Bookmarks

The Notes & Bookmarks becomes visible in the center pane after clicking on the hyperlink from the
Navigation Pane. This pane presents a summary and chronological history of all notes and bookmarks
added to this account.

#### Add Note

Notes can be added to the patient chart by clicking on the **Add Note** button within the Notes &
Bookmarks Pane.

When notes or bookmarks are applied to the chart, the Notes and Bookmarks link in the Navigation
pane will turn red.

![Add Note](image-146.png)

#### Adding formatting

Account Notes also have formatting options for text. Once you type something you can highlights and a
popup with formatting options displays. A user can now select text in those areas and can change the
styles of text.

![Add Note](image-147.jpg)

#### Publicly Visible Note

After clicking the add note button, enter the account note Comment in the Comment window. You have
the option to make this note publicly visible among all users by clicking on the checkbox.

To keep your Comment box open while continuing to work on the chart, click on the Minimize Editor
button. This will move a placeholder to the **Accounts Action Bar**.

![Comment Box](image-149.png)

#### Note Icons

![Add Note Button](image-148.png)
![Notes And Bookmarks](image-153.jpg)

#### Setting a Note/Bookmark to Private

If an end user puts a note on the account, they can make it public or private. Even if an end user marks a
note/bookmark as private users that have a role of administrator or manager can still see private
messages. The private note/bookmark is simply marked private from all other users that do not have the
role of administrator or manager. This feature allows for a manager to review a patient chart and if they
do not want the existing public note to show in the account note, they can change an existing note
private without putting in a new note. Then they have to make it public, then switch it to private in
order to have the account note blank.

![Notes And Bookmarks](image-150.jpg)


#### Add Bookmark to a Text Document

You can add a bookmark to a document by highlighting the relevant word(s), phrase or location within
the text and then right-clicking to open the Bookmark menu.

![Add Bookmark Menu](image-154.jpg)

Left-click the location within the selected document or specific text for bookmarking, then right-click to
open the Bookmark window. From the Bookmark menu, select Bookmark to open the Note window to add your note 
for this bookmark.

![Bookmark Note Editor](image-155.jpg)

Add the note for your bookmark in the Note text box, then click the checkmark button to save the bookmark 
with your note for future reference. Bookmarks within documents will have the bookmark icon. To view 
bookmarks from within a document, click on the green list icon to open and view the bookmark note.

To review all bookmarks within a chart, go to Notes & Bookmarks in the Navigation Pane. All of the 
bookmarks within the chart are listed in the Notes & Bookmarks pane.

You can take further action on bookmarks within the Notes & Bookmarks pane using the following icon
action buttons

| Icon                   | Description |

### Physicians & Queries

Within this page you can add physicians and change the staff function. if it is not correct.

![Physicians & Queries](image-160.jpg)

#### Adding & Editing Physicians

The bottom portion, ‘Account Physicians’, is pre-populated by your registration system. Physicians can
be added, changed, or removed if incorrect or missing. To add a physician, click on the ‘Add Physician’
button and begin typing in the physician’s last name to populate a list to choose from, then click add.
Choose the staff function that fits the physician you choose. If it is a consulting physician enter in the
consultation date.

![Adding & Editing Physicians](image-161.jpg)

#### Removing a Physician

To remove a physician that either you added or was sent incorrectly from the registration system click
on the red ‘X’ button to remove the physician.

#### Save Layout and Reset Filters

When moving around the columns in the Physician Queries grid and then clicking the Save Layout
button, the columns and order will be saved for the Queries grid for all future accounts for that user.
Any other user will see the default layout. Next to the Save Layout button is a Reset Filters button, this
will take any custom layout and change it back to the default fields.

#### Adding a Query

You can also add a physician query if your facility has chosen to use this feature. To add a query to a
physician that is listed, click on either the envelope icon next to the physician or if the physician is not
listed then click on ‘Add Query’.

Add a physician if the physician did not auto fill by clicking on the ‘add physician’ button and begin typing
in the last name. Then click on ‘Select Template’ to choose the query template you wish to use

#### Adding a Cosigner

If configured, you will be able to see a co-signer field that allows you to assign a cosigner. The cosigner
field is a field that can be sent in the outbound interface for the query. The receiving system can
choose to use this process if the co-signer needs to receive the query after the main user answers,
but before it gets returned to Dolbey.

![Adding a Cosigner](image-162.jpg)

When a physician query is created, a new "Cosigner" physician dropdown appears below the existing "Physician"
dropdown. Filling in this field is optional. When the query is saved as a draft or sen outbound, the cosigner
field will be saved with the query and sent as an additional recipient.

In the grid inside the Physicians & Queries, the user may also choose to add "Cosigner" as a visible
column.

#### Creating the Query

Write the query or fill out details as needed. Please refer to your manager for details as each organization
has custom query templates and additional details surrounding queries. Once completed, select from the
reason dropdown why you are sending the query and above that field check the box if the query will affect
final coding.

Click “Send” to complete and send the query or click “Save Draft” if you are not ready to send. If you save
the query as draft, you will notice there is now a draft query section that is separated from sent or closed
queries. If a user has at least one draft, but no sent queries, the total drafts count on their personal
dashboard will display as zero.

Alternatively, for organizations who do not have a physician query interface AND do not create a physician
query until a response is received, a query can be created and not sent. When enabled, a physician query
will show a “Continue” button in place of “Send”. Clicking the “Continue” button will refresh the query to
open the physician response fields so that the query can then be closed.

If you want an automatic signature to be addended to the query you can add it within each users profile.

![Creating the Query](image-163.jpg)

#### Placeholder Queries

Some customers create a physcian query and then copy and paste it into a different system rather then
send them through and interface this is called a place holder query for reporting and transparence of
other users. There is a feature that can be activated within the 2.52 release that allows text entered into
field will no longer display in bold if you want to activate the non-bold text option please contact CAC
Support. The bolding was intially added as an option for those sites to be able to tell what was keyed in
by the end user appart from the template.

#### Query Status

You can see the status of the query in the actions column on the query grid. The following are status
options:

| Status    | Defined |
| --------- | ------- |
| Open      | This is a query that has been sent but not yet responded to by the provider.
| Answered  | This is a query that has been sent and has received a response but, it has yet to be closed by the end user.
| Cancelled | This is a query that has been cancelled by the end user, you will see in the status column cancelled followed by the reason for the cancel such as created in error, wrong account, or others.
| Closed    | This is a query that has been closed by the end user, you will see in the status column closed followed by the outcome of the query such as agree, disagree, no option or no response.

#### Closing a Query

When you are ready to close a query, whether that be to review a response and update the outcome or
to cancel a query, you can click on the envelope icon.

![Closing a Query](image-165.jpg)

Upon clicking on this icon, you would open the query to see the response from the provider if they 
answered.

![Closing a Query](image-164.jpg)

#### Query Response Show Diff

The physician query has a "Show Diff" toggle above physician query responses in the Physician Query
dialog

![Show Query Diff](image-166.jpg)

Clicking it will show additional text in blue highlighting and deleted text in red highlighting. When the
diff is shown, the button changes to "Hide Diff," which when clicked will show the unaltered response.

![Query Diff](image-167.jpg)

> [!info]
> If you have an interface that imports the physicians response the diff logic may report false
> positives and false negatives, like changes from double quotes to single quotes or the addition/deletion
> of blank lines.

After reviewing the response, you can then close the query as agree, disagree, no opinion, no response
or cancel if needed.

![Close Query Bar](image-168.jpg)

#### Documenting Shift Reasons

Shift reasons can be categorized as either automatic or manual. In the case of automatic shift reasons,
the following dialog box will not be visible. However, if you have enabled manual shift reasons, you will
encounter the dialog box below. If you wish to enable or disable this feature, please contact CAC
Support.

Upon selecting an outcome for the query, such as "agreed," and if your site has chosen to collect shift
reasons, a dialog box will appear. This dialog box will display the pre and post-query DRG (if applicable)
along with options for shift reasons. These shift reasons can be chosen by the end user to explain the
rationale behind the change in the DRG. It's important to note that changes in the DRG might occur for
reasons unrelated to the query outcome. Please be aware that the shift reasons dialog is customizable,
so your site may offer different options than what is shown in the screenshot below.

![Shift Reasons](image-169.jpg)
![Shift Reasons Dialog](image-170.jpg)


#### Query Impact

Upon initiation of the query you will see a ‘Compute Button’ below the template name. Click to
compute your Pre-Query DRG if there isn’t one already showing. By clicking this button, it will take
whatever ‘Assigned Codes’ you have currently added to the chart to compute a DRG.

Once the pre-query DRG is completed you would follow the same process to send the query. Once the
query has been responded to you would then open the query to complete and since we are capturing
impact, you will now compute a post-query DRG. Likely the previous DRG would auto-populate unless
you made changes to added, deleted, or changed any codes, re-sequenced or changed the discharge 
disposition. If there is no DRG then follow the same process you did pre-query.

![Query Impact](image-171.jpg)

Post Query you will see a ‘Compute Button’ below the template name.

Click to compute your Pre-Query DRG. By clicking this button, it will take whatever ‘Assigned Codes’ you
have currently added to the chart to compute a DRG you can minimize the query and added, deleted, or
changed any codes, re-sequenced or changed the discharge disposition then recalculate.

#### Quick Complete

The Quick Complete button is designed for sites that create placeholder queries ONLY. This feature
allows a user to log a query without sending it externally. The query logging allows the user to assign a
provider, template, reason, and both pre and post-DRG information along with closing the query with
shift reasons all in one session. This quick complete button aims to streamline these actions into a
single, integrated process. This feature is a new opt-in feature that needs to be turned on. Contact CAC
Support to enable this feature.

Once enabled, create a new physician query, and notice a new "Quick Complete" button in the footer.
Clicking it will automatically save the query and reopen it with "Record Physician Response" expanded to
record a physician's response. The "Quick Complete" button only appears on new queries, including
queries opened from drafts. It will not appear if a query is edited or if a query's physician is changed.

![Quick Complete](image-172.png)

#### Physician Query Grid

At the bottom of the Physicians & Queries page any query that was created will display whether you
were the sender or not. If there is data in the table then there are queries that have been sent. If there
are queries you will see the below grid. This grid will display information about when the query was
created by whom, who it was sent to and if there was a reply and when. The actions column has 3 main
actions; open which means that the query has not been answered, replied meaning that the physician
has replied but the coder has yet to close the query, and Closed – meaning the coder has closed with an
agreed, disagreed or no opinion status.

![Physician Query Grid](image-173.png)

#### Change Physician Queried

This button allows you to change the physician if you sent the query to the wrong physician. Click on the
Change Physician button and select the new physician. This will change the physician and open a Send
New Query button next to the new name. Clicking this will cancel the original query and send the query 
out to the new physician you selected.

![Physician Query](image-175.jpg)

> [!info]
> Your site may not support canceling physician queries. If you redirect the query you may still have
> to cancel the query within the EMR; consult your manager to know if additional steps need to be taken
> to cancel the query in total to the originating physician.

#### Change Physician and Date/Time on Query

You can change the responding Physician since more and more are taking the "team" approach so that a
patient can get quicker care without taxing a single provider. Whomever is on call will take care of the
patient on behalf of the other provider and since the turn around reports are commonly tied a provider
we want to ensure the correct responding provider will get the credit for a quick turnaround.

**How can i change the responding provider?**

Once a query is opened and responded or you decide to record the physician’s response on behalf of the
physician you will see to by the provider you will see a section to select a physician and you can also
update the date in time if you are manually closing queries so that the management reports reflect
accurate turnaround times.

![Physician Query](image-174.jpg)

### Physician Coding Summary

The physician code summary will display if the physician coders are also coding within Fusion CAC, and
they submit the chart. This provides transparency between the facility and physician coding teams as to
what was coded.

By clicking on the header, it will expand the selection so you can see the codes that were coded. If you
see any codes with a plus (+) sign it means that you have not added this code to the account. The plus
(+) sign does not indicate that you need to add this code, it just allows you to quickly add the code if you
have determined you want to use this code using your coding judgment and supporting documentation.

![Physician Coding Summary](image-176.jpg)

### Final Coding Summary

The code summary will display if the facility coders submit the chart. This provides transparency
between CDI and your physician coding teams if they are using Fusion CAC as to what was coded.

By clicking on the header, it will expand the selection so you can see the codes and DRG/APC if
applicable. If you see any codes with a plus (+) sign it means that you have not added this code to the
account. The plus (+) sign does not indicate that you need to add this code it just allows you to quickly
add the code if you have determined you want to use this code using your coding judgment and
supporting documentation.

![Final Coding Summary](image-177.jpg)

### Working CDI History

The working CDI History can be used to look at historical working DRG calculations. The coders cannot
edit this information, but they can review the data.

The first calculated DRG will assume the Baseline DRG role, which is used to calculate the CDI impact on
a chart. If you wish to change the Baseline DRG, you can click the "Set Baseline DRG" button.

#### Adding an Alternative Working DRG

You can also indicate which Working DRGs are an alternative DRG for reconciliation. By checking the box
next to each DRG, you are approving it as an alternative DRG to auto-reconcile the chart. You can
manually add an additional DRG if it does not appear in the list.

![Alternative Working DRG](image-178.jpg)

By clicking on the arrow prior to the DRG information it will expand the selection so you can see the
codes that went into the DRG and the sequence. If you see any codes with a plus sign it means that you
have not added this code to the account. The plus sign does not indicate that you need to add this code
it just allows you to quickly add the code if you have determined you want to use this code using your
coding judgment and supporting documentation. If applicable, the code’s HCC designation will show the
HCC number and its version.

![Alternative Working DRG](image-179.jpg)

### Suggested DRG

Fusion CAC suggests a DRG on inpatient charts. This Suggested DRG is computed by the system within a
set interval (typically every six hours of the patient’s admission provided there is enough documentation
to suggest codes used to compute a DRG).

The Suggested DRG is then re-calculated every six hours until discharge or a CDI Specialist or Coder
computes a DRG. At that time the Suggested DRG is discontinued. The Suggested DRG along with other
data elements are not commonly used within Fusion CAC, rather this data is sent outbound to be used
by other healthcare professionals ,such as physicians and case managers, to predict the number of days
that the insurance (payor) will pay for the patient to stay within the hospital based upon the current
diagnosis of the patient. The common data element used by case management and physicians is called
the GMLOS (Geometric Means Length of Stay).

#### How does suggested DRG work?

The suggested DRG module leverages the codes that are suggested by the FAE engine. The FAE engine
collects all codes suggested along with the section header that it was extracted from. The diagnosis
codes are then compared against a configuration file called “Invalid Headers”. If the diagnosis came
from a section header within this file it is discarded from consideration for the principal diagnosis. The
principal diagnosis code commonly is the driver of the DRG category; thus, the section of what diagnosis
is named principal is crucial in the success of the Suggested DRG. Once the codes have been picked
through for candidates, the codes are then passed through a modeling system to select the principal
diagnosis based upon historical data that the model has been trained upon.

#### Why do we discard diagnosis from being candidates for a principal diagnosis?

A patient’s chart contains a lot of information including historical information that is relevant for the
patient’s chart, but should not be considered as a principal diagnosis. The principal diagnosis can be
defined as primary diagnosis to which the majority of the resources were applied or the main reason the
patient was admitted. The “invalid headers” that are thrown out include medical history, problem list,
social history, and family history, among others.

#### How is Suggested DRG displayed with Fusion CAC?

It is displayed within a viewer called Suggested DRG. This is housed under the navigation tree and
displayed for users to see the timeline of the suggested DRG and how it evolved overtime. Below is a
screenshot of what the suggested DRG viewer looks like within the navigation tree. By clicking on the
blue header the tree will expand and show the coder along with the principal diagnosis that was
selected.

![Alternative Working DRG](image-180.jpg)

### Discrete Values and Flow Sheet Viewers

> [!info]
> This is a viewer that not all customers have access to. This an optional feature and may not be
> supported by your EMR vendor. The discrete values show trending data or data that has values. The most
> common examples of discrete values are lab values and vital signs.

Once you have clicked on Discrete Values or the Flow Sheet Viewer from the navigation tree you will be
presented with one of the two views depending on your desired configuration during the project.

#### Flow Sheet Viewer

The flowsheet viewer is the most recent style of discrete data viewer. This viewer is organized much like
a spreadsheet. Depending on your configuration, you may see major categories on the left-hand side of
the spreadsheet telling you lab power forms could be vital signs. (There are many different options as
each site is a little different.) Upon clicking on one of these items you will be presented with a grid to the
right. That grid will have multiple columns, the first column being name if you hover over the column
name you will see three little lines if you click on them, it will allow you to filter so that you can narrow
down the data. If any of those names appear in red that means that at least one of the data elements
are outside of the normal limits if there is a range.

To the right of the name you will see, if applicable, a reference column. This reference column will tell
you if the value is within normal limits. This is data that your EMR system has sent to the CAC system. If
the reference column is available, then to the right of that you will have a flag column. I A checkmark in
that field also means the value is out of the normal range to provide an additional indicator than just
the red coloring on the name. This column can also be filtered if you wish to look at everything outside
of the normal limits. Next to that field you will be presented with a date and time column, and you may
see multiple dates and times depending on how the data is organized and how frequently it is
documented.

![Flow Sheet Viewer](image-181.jpg)

If a discrete value on the Flowsheet viewer has a specimen, it will show as a beaker symbol in the
Results column. Hovering over the symbol will provide the name and site of the specimen.

![Flow Sheet Viewer](image-182.jpg)

#### Collapsing/Expanding

If you right click in the Major Category column will show a menu allowing the user to expand or collapse
all categories. That configuration will be saved for all accounts that have the Flowsheet viewer, per user
role. Note that if a user collapses/uncollapses a major category in the pop out, it will not be seen on the
main page until the user moves to a different viewer and back.

![Flow Sheet Viewer - Collapsing/Expanding](image-184.jpg)

#### Discrete Values Viewer

An older style of discrete data can also be displayed in a discrete values viewer where you may see tab
across the top to display the categories of data. This displays each of the types of discrete data elements
your site has; however, your site might have different topics than the screenshot.

The Discrete Values viewer will display a Filter by Month box, listing the months that contain values.
Selecting a month will highlight all the corresponding dates in the Filter by Date box. The resulting
values will show in the viewing pane. The Normal and Abnormal tabs both have this functionality and
are filtered separately.

Discrete Values with a grey header are within normal limits, your organization sends what is the
reference point to determine what is normal and what is abnormal. If a header is display in red, it’s
considered abnormal by your organization. In addition to the header color, you can tell if the value is out
of normal limits as there is a flag that
indicates if the value is low vs. high.

![Discrete Values Viewer](image-185.jpg)

> [!info]
> The flow sheet or discrete data viewer can be popped out into another window by clicking on a
> little square with an arrow pointing to the right in the navigation tree next to the flowsheet or data
> viewer name.

### Charges or Transactions

If an interface for account charges is set up during configuration, the Charges screen shows a listing of
charges on the account and provides activity buttons to **Save Layout** or **Expand** the Charges or transactions
pane. 

![Charges or Transactions](image-192.jpg)

You can expand the width of the Charges or transactions pane to view more available columns by 
clicking on the in the top right corner of the pane.

This pane also provides information on **CPT Codes**, **Descriptions**, **Modifiers**, **Quantity**, 
**Service Date**, **Revenue Code**, and **Total Price**.

#### Column Settings

Each column within the Charges Grid has menu options to pin the column, Auto size, and reset columns. 
Click on the Menu icon to view the drop-down listing. 

![Column Settings](image-195.png)

After making your column setting selections,  click on the button to retain your column settings for 
future coding sessions.

| Icon                        | Description |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| ![Icon](image-186.jpg)      | Allows you to select the column and then pin it to the RIGHT or LEFT side of the assigned accounts grid. This function works similarly to freezing columns in Excel. |
| ![Icon](image-187.png)      | Select this option to change the column width to automatically size the width of the column for contents of the cells in this column. |
| ![Icon](image-188.png)      | To quickly Auto size all columns in the assigned accounts grid, click the **Auto size All Columns** button. |
| ![Icon](image-189.png)      | Click on this option to Reset Columns to their default column width. |

#### Adding Modifiers to Charges

Click on the ellipsis button in the Modifiers column next to the CPT Code that requires a modifier.

Click on the minus button to open the Modifiers window. Start entering the digits for the modifier to bring
up the drop-down listing of available modifiers and their descriptions to select the appropriate modifier.
After the modifier is in the window, click on the check button to save the selected modifier. Continue this
process to add all applicable modifiers to charges in the Charges pane. The user can add up to 4
modifiers unless they are using the 3M CRS encoder, then they will be able to add up to 5 modifiers.

#### Assigning diagnosis codes to Hard Charges

A user with the role of a physician coder can now add assigned diagnosis codes along withphysicians and
CPT Modifier codes to hard charges listed in the Charges viewer. When a physician coder opens the
charges viewer, new columns with edit buttons will be seen.

![Assigning diagnosis codes](image-200.jpg)

Clicking on the edit button for the Diagnosis column will open a code field, which, when dropped down, will
list all assigned Diagnosis codes on the account. The physician coder can then select which diagnosis code 
to attach that hard charge. The Physician column edit button will open a physician field to allow the 
selection of a physician, and the Physician Modifiers column edit button will open a modifier window allowing 
modifiers to be selected. When launching the encoder, the physician coder’s modifiers will be sent instead 
of the final modifiers on charge viewer.

> [!info]
> You must have physician coding enabled to use this feature, if you do not have physician coding
> please contact your account representative for more information.

#### Assigning a Pending Reason per Charge

Users that have a physician coder or single path coding role will have the ability to place a pending
reason per charge on the physician charges.

- If a charge is removed, then the pending reason would be removed.
- If a charge is updated, then the pending reason would not change.

![Assigning a Pending Reason](image-199.jpg)

#### Caution Column

A Caution Column is avaialble for sites that use the TruCode Encoder to the Transactions and Charges
viewers. This column will indicate a flag if TruCode reports an edit on a charge on an outpatient
account.

![Caution Column](image-201.jpg)

### Medications Viewer

A Medication Administration Record (MAR, or eMAR for electronic versions), commonly referred to as
a drug chart, is the report that serves as a legal record of the drugs administered to a patient at a facility
by a health care professional. The MAR is a part of a patient's permanent record on their medical chart.
The health care professional signs off on the record at the time that the drug or device is administered.
Common information collected such as

- Medication
- Dosage
- Route
- Start and End Date/Time
- Status

![Medications Viewer](image-202.jpg)

### Final Code Summary

The final code summary will only be available once the coder clicks the submit button. Once you submit
the chart and then open again you will see a new viewer under the navigation menu called the Final
Code Summary. This will show you what the coders coded for along with code status details and
sequencing. This data is view only available if your current role is ‘CDI’. If your current role is a coder,
this information will not be available; you can see this information on the code summary viewer.

![Medications Viewer](image-204.jpg)

If you see any codes with a plus sign it means that you have not added this code to the account. The plus
sign does not indicate that you need to add this code it just allows you to quickly add the code if you
have determined you want to use this code using your CDI judgement and supporting documentation. If
applicable, the code’s HCC designation will show the HCC number and its version.

### DRG Reconciliation

The DRG Reconciliation viewer displays the differences between the last known working DRG and the
final DRG coded by a coder, with symbols indicating the discrepancies. The viewer updates in real time
and does not store historical information. If the coder updates the DRG, the changes will reflect
immediately in the DRG Reconciliation viewer. For historical data, please refer to reports

![Medications Viewer](image-203.jpg)

### 30 Day Readmit

If the patient has been readmitted within 30 days of the admit date, the patient demographic data will
display below from the previous stay. If the previous stay was also coded, you will see the code

![30 Day Readmit](image-205.jpg)

summary display below. If a check mark appears next to the code, this indicates the code on the
previous stay was also suggested for the current stay.

### Previous HCC Overview

The previous HCC overview will display the HCC history to show for both the current and prior year.
HCCs will be collected once the HCCs has been enabled in the mapping table. It is recommended to turn
HCCs on for all patient types to capture a more complete picture of HCCs. As a reminder, this will not
capture data prior to turning this feature on in the mapping table. (In mappings, under the Categories
mapping, there is a check box.) When HCCs are enabled, these will display below grouped by HCC
category and by code — showing the account number and MRN # for the visits each were associated to.

If a check mark appears next to the HCC category and code, this indicates the code on the previous stay
was also suggested for the current stay. If the patient chart you are currently coding has codes that
result in HCCs once they are added to the assigned code tree the code will display with an ‘H’ next to the
code. By hovering over the ‘H’ icon, the HCC category will display.

![Previous HCC Overview](image-207.png)

### Transfer Codes from Previous Encounter Viewer

Transfer codes can be used to help combine account codes into one encounter. Most sites leverage the
ADT to combine the actual account, however, you may need to copy codes from one encounter to
another.

If a patient has two different accounts and the coder has already done work on each of the accounts,
the Transfer Codes feature can be an easy way to post codes when you’re within one account and want
to search in another account, and have the ability to open that other account and see the codes.
To transfer codes, type in the account number, then click load account. Once you have loaded the
account, use the check boxes to the left of the codes to choose which codes you will transfer. Once you
have finished that, select “Transfer Codes” and the codes you selected will be added to the “assigned
code” tree that is on the current account.

![Transfer Codes from Previous Encounter Viewer](image-206.jpg)

### Denial Management Viewer

Denial management tracking involves monitoring cases where a patient's submitted billing chart is
rejected by the payer. Various reasons, such as medical necessity, code, or DRG assignment, could lead
to these denials. This tool is designed to comprehensively record the specifics related to denial
management and tracking. It is capable of documenting multiple denials for each chart, with the ability
to log and categorize them for the purpose of tracking, managing workflows, and generating reports.

![Denial Management Viewer](image-208.jpg)

If an account is submitted, a new "Denial Management" viewer will appear in the Navigation tree.
Clicking on this viewer presents a form with several fields to be filled in when an account has been
denied payment. If the desired the user can create validation rules on input.

Mutiple denial sheets can be created within the viewer, if applicable.o

![Denial Management](image-209.jpg)

Sheets can be removed from the account by clicking on the red X to the right of each denial heading. For
reporting within Account Search, a Denials drilldown is available. This drilldown only reports on the first
denial on the account.

Dropdown items have a default, but mappings with the following IDs can customize the dropdown
entries:

- DenialType
- DenialStatus
- DenialOutcome
- DenialAppealRoute
- DenialReason
- DenialCodeChangeNeeded
- DenialDRGChangeNeeded

![Denial Management](image-210.jpg)

All values are saved in a new separate "DenialManagement" object on the account. Each field (except
Comments) can be added to Grid Column Management for display in Account Search, these fields can
also be used in workflow if necessary.

![Denial Management](image-211.jpg)

### ER E/M Viewer

The ER E/M Viewer is an add-on module for any chart with a “Is Emergency”
flag within the account properties. If you do not have this module, today
contact the SME Team (smeteam@dolbey.com) for more information.

If this module is turned on on any “Is Emergency” chart you find the “E/M
Coding Worksheet” in the Navigation menu.

To begin ER charging click on the “E/M Coding Worksheet” in the Navigation
menu.

There are several sections to the E/M Coding worksheet including: E/M No Charge, E/M Level, Trauma,
Critical Care, Medications, and Additional Charging.

#### ER Date and Provider

The first step is filling in the ER Date and the ER Physician fields. Once these are completed, the rest of
the worksheet will populate.

![ER Date and Provider](image-212.jpg)

#### No Charge

If a patient fits the criteria for “no charges” (for example, a registration error), all other fields in the
worksheet go away because there is nothing else to be done from an ER charging perspective. However,
other selections from the list will populate the fields accordingly.

![No Charge](image-213.jpg)

#### Critical Care

The next field to be considered is “Critical Care”. Select appropriate answers to “Is Criteria Met” and “Is
Time Determined.” To enter the duration, click on the clock icon.

![Critical Care](image-215.jpg)

Enter start date/time and select “Update” for the minutes to display.

![Critical Care](image-216.jpg)

If there were multiple spans of time for critical care,
click on +Add and enter any additional durations of
time. The system will add up on the minutes and
display once “Update” has been selected.

![Critical Care](image-218.jpg)

#### E/M Levels Matrix

Once you select an element from one of the columns, that becomes the minimal level and all columns
before that will gray out. In this example, once “Observation” is selected, the Level 1-3 columns gray out.
As you complete the remaining sections, you may see the level advance.

![Critical Care](image-217.jpg)

#### Trauma

If the case was a trauma, make the appropriate selection from the dropdown menu (pre-hospital
notification, post-hospital notification, consult).

![Trauma](image-219.jpg)

#### Medication Administration Qty

Based on the selection, additional fields or boxes will populate. Complete the quantities, add modifiers,
and any notes. Modifier fields are available in the appropriate sections of the worksheet. The “Notes”
field is available for the coder to track things, like medications. The user can add up to 4 modifiers
unless they are using the 3M CRS encoder, then they will be able to add up to 5 modifiers.

![Medication Administration Qty](image-220.jpg)

#### Medication Administration Time/Modifier

Update this section with the duration, any modifier, and notes. The user can add up to 4 modifiers
unless they are using the 3M CRS encoder, then they will be able to add up to 5 modifiers.

![Medication Administration Time/Modifier](image-221.jpg)

If there are multiple infusions (for example, one infusion started in left arm and one infusion stated in
the right arm), click on the Action button.

![Medication Action Button](image-222.jpg)

Clicking on the Action will create another row to be completed including appropriate modifier.

![Medication Action Button](image-223.jpg)

#### Additional Charges

Add any additional charges

![Additional Charges](image-224.jpg)

#### Charges for Assigned CPT Codes

If the outpatient/inpatient coder adds a CPT code (otherwise referred to as “soft code”), the codes will
appear in this section of the E/M Coding worksheet. A determination will need to be made by the ER
charger if the procedure added by the coder occurred in the ER and should be charged. If so, the fields
should be completed. It the procedure is determined to have occurred elsewhere, leave the 0 in the
field. (Note that when there is a CPT coded added that has no CDM charge, it won’t appear in this
section; only those that have a CDM.)

![CPT Charges](image-225.jpg)

#### E/M Summary

Once you complete the Additional Charges, you will see the Summary which details the E/M level and
other charges with the corresponding CDM Code.

![E/M Summary](image-226.jpg)

When all charging is complete and the charges are ready to be submitted, check the “Send Charges
Outbound” and select “SAVE” in the banner bar.

![E/M Summary Banner Bar](image-228.jpg)

This action sends charges out and the account will automatically route to an outpatient/inpatient coder
worklist so the rest of the coding that is not charge-related can be completed.

If the charges can’t be completed for some reason (missing trauma documentation), the box should NOT
be checked, and instead, a pending reason should be assigned on the Code Summary. Once a pending
reason has been added, select “SAVE” in the banner bar.

![E/M Summary](image-229.jpg)

If the “Send Charges Outbound” box is NOT checked, the outpatient/inpatient coder will get a warning
that ER charges are missing and not be able to submit the account upon completion of the coding. The
coder, in this case, would attach a pending reason to send the account back to the ER charger to check
box. The account then goes back to the coder to submit the account for final billing. This workflow
ensures that the outpatient/inpatient coder does not submit an account unless all ER charges have been
completed

#### E/M History

This section displays the history of charges submitted.

Click to expand for details.

![E/M History](image-230.jpg)

#### Documents Tree and Pane

![E/M History](image-236.jpg)

The Documents Pane frames the Documents Tree and is located on the left-hand side of the Account Screen.
The Documents Tree includes a listing of all documents in a patient chart categorized by document type
as configured by the hospital.

Icons next to document names in the Documents Tree indicate document types. Each document in the
Documents Tree uses an icon or bolding to give information about the document. Listed below are
Document Indicators.

For convenience, you may want to **pop out** the document into a separate window to continue viewing it
while accessing other areas of the chart.

On the documents panel you will see a backward and forward arrow, This will allow the user to move up
and down through the documents listed in the panel.

| Icon                   | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| ![Icon](image-232.jpg) | Open document in new tab/window |
| ![Icon](image-233.jpg) | Image document |
| ![Icon](image-234.jpg) | Text document |
| ![Icon](image-235.jpg) | You have not view this document.  The title is NOT BOLD after you view the document (but will still be BOLD for other users until they view the document.)
| ![Icon](image-237.jpg) | Document with engine code suggestions |
| **Black Background**   | Fusion CAC will now archive documents that contain codes assigned by coders. This document will appear in the Documents pane with white text against a black background. Bookmarks on those documents will also be retained. Doing a Ctrl Click on the document header in the viewer will now show the archive date and time. ![](image-238.jpg) ![](image-239.jpg)|


### Text Document Visual Differences

The ability to see the differences between two documents has been added. This is for text only
document; attempting to use images or manual documents will result in a red
toast message advising the user to use a different document.

![Text Document](image-241.jpg)

To see differences, the user must first open a document. Next, they will right
click on another document in the document tree and select View Diff from the
menu. This will bring up a new tab. The left side of the tab will show the older
document, and the right side will show the newer document. The older
document will show strike-outs wherever something was changed, and the right
side will show blue highlights for anything that was added. In the example, an
older Consultation document is being matched against a newer Consultation document.

![Text Document](image-240.jpg)

### Search Button

The Documents pane includes a Search button. Click on the Search button to open and enter the
specific terms or phrase to be found within the documents in the chart. After pressing the Enter key,
documents that include the searched term or phrase will be highlighted in
**{{< rawhtml >}}<span style="color:#a00">RED</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}**.

Click on the document highlighted in
**{{< rawhtml >}}<span style="color:#a00">RED</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}**
to view the searched term/phrase within the document. Each
occurrence of the searched term/phrase will be highlighted
in yellow.

![Search](image-242.jpg)

Upon clicking the search button, a floating window will now open and will fill with all results for
the search word. Each result will display the name and date of the document along with a short
portion of the sentence containing the word. The arrows allow you to move up and down through the
list. This window stays active when using auto-load and will update with each account’s search
results. The window can be minimized to a ‘Restore’ button on the Document tree. Clicking on the
Restore button will re-open the search window and will display the results.

### Read/Unread

When returning to a chart after new documents have been added, documents that have not previously
been reviewed will appear in **BOLD** text. Documents that have been previously viewed will appear in
normal text.

### Document Viewer

The document pane is in the middle in which displays a document or viewer clicked on within the
document tree or navigation pane.

![Document Viewer](image-243.jpg)

On the main header there are backward and forward arrows now appear to the left in the blue bar of
the viewer panel in account detail. This will allow users to move back and forth through documents that
have been opened onto the viewer screen. Note that when a user arrows back and forth, then clicks on
another document, the user starts a new history for that option.

If there is a physician on a document, the name will show in the document viewer header, on the
popout, and in the Ctrl+ click of the header.

![Document Viewer](image-244.png)

### Pop Out Document

Click on the **pop out** icon to open the selected document in a new window. The document opens in
a new window for continued viewing while other areas of the chart are accessed during the current
coding session.

![Document Viewer](image-246.png)

![Document Viewer](image-247.jpg)

### Sort Documents

Sorting documents within the Documents pane is available by right-clicking on a document within
the pane and selecting **Sort**, then **Default**, **A-Z**, **Z-A**, **Date Ascending**, or 
**Date Descending**.

![Sort Documents](image-248.jpg)

You can reorganize the Document Tree by right clicking on the documents. You
can click on sort; this will allow you to sort the documents within the folders
alphabetically or date. You can also sort chronologically which removes all
folders and will organize all documents in chronological order.

### Expand Documents

![Sort Documents](image-249.jpg)

Right-click on a document within the Documents pane and select **Expand** to
visualize all documents within a documents folder or all suggested codes
within each document. The default view is **Expand Documents**, with options
to **Collapse All**. This is helpful if you just want to see the folder structure to
see what options you have to then open a folder to view those specific
documents. 

### Zoom Documents

To adjust the level of zoom on a document, right-click within the document
and click “Zoom”. This feature is available both on the main page and in
popped out documents. When a user selects a zoom level, that level will be
retained for all documents. The last zoom level used before sign out is the
zoom level the user will get when they sign back in.

![Zoom Documents](image-250.png)

The right click zoom will not be available for photo documents or pdf documents,
since they have their own. Zoom will also not be available on worksheets. This
feature is not compatible for Firefox users because Firefox does not support the style.

#### Documented Codes

If the document has a plus sign to the left of the document name, there
are codes within the document for review and validation.

![Documented Codes](image-254.jpg)

Click on the **\[+\]** next to a document to expand and show all codes found
on the selected document.

*Before Clicking*
![Documented Codes Tree](image-253.png)

*After Clicking*
![Documented Codes Tree](image-252.png)

Clicking on a document will load the document in the document viewer. Clicking on a suggested code
listed underneath the document will take you to highlighted text within the document that triggered the
engine to make that code suggestion.

#### Procedure Codes

Under unassigned Diagnosis Codes are listed all unassigned **Procedure Codes** that have been suggested
by the engine for validation. Left-clicking on the procedure code will take you to the location within the
document that prompted the code suggestion.

#### CPT® Codes

Under unassigned Procedure Codes are listed all unassigned **CPT® Codes** that have been suggested by
the engine for validation. Left-clicking on the CPT® code will take you to the location within the
document that prompted the code suggestion.

#### Assigned Codes

![Assigned Codes](image-255.jpg)

The Assigned pane sits above the Unassigned pane on the right-hand side of the
Account Screen. The Assigned pane includes Admit Diagnosis, Principal and/or
Visit Reasons Assigned Diagnoses, Principal and Secondary ICD-10 Procedures
and Assigned CPT® Codes. Once a coder validates a code from the document or
right clicks and assigned a code from the unassigned codes menu, they will
appear in the assigned codes pane. All codes on submit within this pane will go
outbound to your abstraction or billing system. Codes can be removed from
here by right-clicking and selecting unassign.

Codes falling below the 25th position will display within a light purple color.

### Code Editor

This is an additional quicker way to open the Code Editor dialog via the right-click menu right from the
assigned code tree. When clicking on the code from the assigned code tree you will edit only the code
along with the position you have clicked on. However, if you use the hot key from the unassigned code
tree you will open a full code editor, since no action has been assigned yet to that code.

![Code Editor](image-256.jpg)

### Add Code Set Button

Click on the Add Set button to add a code set configured based on facility needs.

![Code Set Button](image-257.jpg)

You have the option of adding codes from a code set for standard procedures based on facility settings.
Click on the Add Set button to open the **Add code from code set** window then click on the down arrow to
review a menu of code sets.

![Code Set Button](image-258.png)

Click on the Code Set to view a listing of the codes for this code set.

![Code Set Button](image-259.png)

Click OK to simultaneously add all codes from this code set to the chart.

### Admit Diagnosis

Listed first in the Assigned pane is the Admit Diagnosis. You can right-click
on any assigned diagnosis code and select Copy as Admit Diagnosis to add
the code as the Admit Diagnosis. This right click menu will change
depending on if you click on diagnosis or procedures and if you are in an
inpatient vs outpatient chart.

![Codes](image-260.jpg)

### Assigned Diagnoses

Under Admit Diagnosis are listed all Assigned Diagnoses as they are
validated and added via direct entry or using the encoder. There is no
designation for principal but, it will display as the first listed under assigned
diagnosis and it will appear in bold text. You will need to right click on the code you want to add as an
assigned principal code to see the bold text.

### Assigned ICD-10 Procedures

Listed beneath Assigned Diagnoses are all Assigned ICD-10 Procedures as they are validated and added
using the encoder.

### Assigned CPT® Codes

Following the listed Assigned ICD-10 Procedures are the Assigned CPT® Codes

### Unassigned Codes

The Unassigned pane sits beneath the Assigned pane on the right-hand side of the Account Screen. The
Unassigned pane includes Diagnosis Codes, Procedures Codes and CPT® Codes. From this pane, you can toggle
between showing All Codes or just the Unassigned Codes

![Unassigned Codes](image-264.jpg)

The user can view all codes suggested by the engine within the Unassigned Codes pane. This allows the 
user to view each code with a link to the documentation and context of words and phrases which prompted
the code suggestion.

If the code has a plus sign to the left of the code, there are codes within the document for review
and validation.

### Allow Coders to hide CDI added codes

If a CDI adds a code to a document, this can now be hidden by the
Coder. When the Coder opens the account, a new box in the
Unassigned Codes Pane will be viewable. When checked, any code
added to a document by a CDI will be hidden from the list.

![Unassigned Codes](image-265.jpg)

### Show All/Show Unassigned Button

Click on the Show All button to toggle between showing All Codes suggested by the engine on this
account or Show Unassigned to view just the suggested codes pending validation to be moved to the
Assigned Codes pane.

### Bold assigned codes in the Show All code tree

If there is a code that appears on multiple document types and one of those is assigned, it will now appear as BOLD
in the Show All codes tree. In this example, the code was assigned on the Consultation document type. Please
note, this may not be retroactive.

![Unassigned Codes](image-261.jpg)

### Displayed Icons

In this pane there are 2 different symbols you may see. If you do not see an icon next to the code the
engine suggested these codes.

| Icon                     | Description |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| ![Icon](person.png)      | The Person icon indicate a user manually entered this code and the system **did not** suggest it, by hoovering over this icon it will display the user who manually added it. ![Unassigned Codes](image-262.jpg) |
| ![Icon](exclamation.png) | The exclamation mark icon indicates a user manually entered this code and the system **did** suggest it. If you click on the + next to the code then select the person icon can you see by hoovering over the person icon it will display the user whom manually added it. |

### Code Comments

A comment can now be added to a code on the document tree, or the Unassigned/Show All code tree. The
comment will show as a green flag in the trees and on the code in the document. On the trees, the comment is
readable via a hover over; in the document itself, the flag can be clicked to open the comment. The comment can
be added to or deleted by erasing the text. The comment will show in its own section in the Notes and Bookmarks
viewer, and can be edited or deleted there.

![Code Comments](image-266.jpg)

![Code Comments](image-267.jpg)

#### Finish Working in an Account

Once you have finished working in an account, there are three ways of proceeding

![Actions](image-268.png)

- **Cancel** - This cancels all work in the chart and either returns to the Workgroup or autoloads the next account (if autoload is selected). Upon canceling if you have unsaved changes you will be prompted. ![Are You Sure](image-269.png)
- **Save** - This saves your work and either returns to the Workgroup or autoloads the next account (if autoload is selected.)
- **Submit** - This saves and sends your work to the next phase of workflow, based on your organizations requirements and either returns to the Workgroup or autoloads the next account (if autoload is selected).

### Account Changed Warning Box

![Warning Box](image-272.jpg)

Upon selecting one of these options, Fusion CAC may present a pop-up
warning that reads, “Warning: Account Changed. The account has been
changed by an upstream system” This warning appears when Fusion CAC
has received a change to the account – usually a new document – between
the time the account was opened and when the user chooses to Cancel,
Save, or Submit. This warning allows the user to double check their work
based on new information provided to Fusion CAC.

Selecting **“Save and Apply”** will apply the incoming changes to the account
and continue with the process the user had selected. Choosing **“Apply”** will
apply the incoming changes to the account and return the user to the
account to continue working.

### Ending a Coding Session (Log Off)

![Log Off](image-275.jpg)

To log out of the application, click on the down-arrow next to your user name in the
top right corner of the software, then select ‘Log Out.’
