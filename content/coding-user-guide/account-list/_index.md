## Accessing your Workgroup

A Workgroup definition is a list of work that needs to be completed by the user. Workgroups, although
custom per organization, are usually broken down by patient type or hospital service. For more
information on how work is routed to the Workgroups you are associated with contact your supervisor.

To access each Workgroup, start by clicking on the down arrow on the Assigned to button for a drop-
down listing of your assigned Workgroups. If you do not see any groups in your drop-down, ensure the
drop-down menu to the left of ‘Assigned to’ says ‘Accounts’, if it does contact your supervisor.

## Sorting and Filtering Accounts in a Workgroup

Once you have selected the Workgroup that you have been
assigned, a grid with charts should appear. You can customize
the visual presentation of account details using the column
menu settings to pin, auto size, sort, filter, and select columns to display.

configuration is applied


## Selecting a Patient Account from a Workgroup

Click anywhere on the row of your selected account to open it for review and coding.
If you are working from a printed work list or want to look up a specific chart, you can access the chart
by typing the account number into the Account # field on the right side of the Account List bar. The
entered chart will open after you hit the Enter key or click the List icon ![list](image-015.png).

## Recent Views

The recent views drop down allows you to quickly find the charts you recently accessed in sequenced
order.

## Pending Accounts

A "Pending Accounts" dropdown option is now accessible in the Account List page that displays all
accounts in which the current user has recorded a pending reason, similar to the "Pending Accounts" list
in the Force Autoload dashboard.

## MRN Search

If a chart has multiple MRN’s and you want to search for a different account, you can use this search. By
clicking on MRN search you will have a space to enter in the MRN that you are searching for and then in
the grid below you will see the MRN’s that match.
