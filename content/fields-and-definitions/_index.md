This section contains an alphabetical list of fields and definitions in the application.

Fields are configured to be available in account search,workflow, and account list grid. These fields and their friendly names are set in the [grid columns configuration](https://dolbeysystems.github.io/fusion-cac-web-docs/administrative-user-guide/tools/grid-column-configuration/) by administrative users. This list may not have the full listing of fields as some fields are custom, however those listed are the most common.
