This program will introduce automatic workflow processes which is defined as processes where tasks,
information or documents are passed from one place to another for action, according to a set of
procedural rules.

Each organization will have different workflows from one another to coordinate tasks between people
and synchronize data between systems, with the ultimate goal of improving organizational efficiency
and responsiveness.

Each CDS will have a worklist which will include new cases if current patient location meets the CDS
work assignments and follow-up cases that the chart owner has been assigned for the CDS reviewing.

For example, if the patient chart is a new case then the patient chart (if it’s an inpatient chart and has a
fin class of Medicare) will route based on the patient’s current location to one of the CDS Workgroups.

By default, the chart will queue up every day (interval can change based on your policies and/or patient
types).
