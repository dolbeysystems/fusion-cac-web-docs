Fusion CAC is a **browser-based** program. To launch the CAC browser application,
open your web browser and enter your siteâ€™s Fusion CAC server address into the
{{%button%}}browser address bar{{%/button%}}.  You will need to get the Fusion
CAC server address from your {{%icon icon="user-tie"%}} site administrator or
manager.

> [!info] Fusion CAC URL Example
> **https://fusion-cac-production/cac2**

>*This address is just an example. The address for your server will be different.*

> [!note] Shortcut
Your facility may have created an shortcut icon on your desktop to make it easier
for you to quickly connect to the Fusion CAC application.

> [!warning] Account Lock-Out
Five consecutive failed logins will cause your account to be locked out of the
application.  If you are locked out, contact your {{% icon icon="user-tie" %}} supervisor.

## {{% icon icon="lock" %}} Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)

> [!important] Your organization may not have Two-Factor Authentication configured
Two-factor authentication must be configured for your site by the Dolbey Support team.
If your site is not using two-factor authentication, this section will not apply to your login
process.

> [!warning] Account Lock-Out In Two-Factor Flow
Five consecutive failed logins at either stage will cause your account to be locked out of the
application.  If you are locked out, contact your {{% icon icon="user-tie" %}} supervisor.

If your site is configured for **two-factor authentication**, after your first login, you will be
taken to a screen showing a QR code to scan or a key to enter into
an authenticator app on your {{% icon icon="phone" %}} smartphone.  

Once you have scanned or saved the code to your authenticator app, the TOTP (time-based one-time
password) entry for Fusion CAC will appear in your authenticator  app with a title similar to this:

```
Fusion CAC Dolbey Health Production: heminger
```

At this point, your {{% icon icon="phone" %}} authenticator app has been configured and will now
give you time-based codes to log in to the Fusion CAC coding application.

To view the time-based code when logging into the app, select the entry in your authenticator app.
You should see a long sequence of characters that will change every minute.  When you login to the
Fusion CAC application, you will need to view and enter this key from your {{%icon icon="phone"%}}
authenticator app into the field beneath the password field.

> [!note] What if I get a new phone?
Your {{%icon icon="user-tie"%}} site administrator or supervisor can reset your two-factor
authentication setup if you have replaced or reset your phone and no longer have access
to the "Fusion CAC" entry in your authenticator application.
