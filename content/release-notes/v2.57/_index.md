### Allow Users to be Assigned to Managers

**CACTWO-5140 {{< rawhtml >}}<span style="color:#1F497D">(Enhancement)</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}**

A new field will display within User Management that can be used by 
administrators and managers to assign users to a manager.
The manager field is a dropdown that will only show users with a manager 
role. Clicking the blue button next to the field will allow the addition of more 
users to that selected manager. When a manager has users assigned, then 
when that manager runs User Reports, they will only see the users that are 
assigned to them. A new manager column has been added to the User 
Management grid.

A new button has been added to Grid Column Configuration that will enable 
the user to bulk add columns. When the button is clicked, a box will open showing only available columns. 
User can check as many columns as needed and click OK to have them added 
to Grid Column Configuration.
